Chris, who is good friends with Blake and Miranda came forth addressing the matter claiming it to be downright false.&nbsp;Young&nbsp;expressed&nbsp;to Dailymail,&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>"I don't normally address gossip but in this case I will, My name has been mentioned as a contributing factor in Blake and Miranda's divorce. That is totally FALSE. They are both my friends and I would not betray that friendship. Just wanted to clear that up."</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Chris Young,&nbsp;Miranda Lambert together&nbsp;</strong>(Photo: dailymail.co.uk)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Chris Young and Miranda Lambert had also toured together in 2012.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Moreover, it was not just Chris who came to the light of attention in Blake Shelton and his wife's divorce as sources revealed that there was another un-named man involved too.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>After the divorce, both Blake and Miranda have found love again.

Pope even gushed mentioning that it's just their fans who like to think otherwise about their relationship status. In an interview with Billboard,&nbsp;she gushed,</p><p style=text-align:justify>"It's so funny.

Obviously, the song is from that tough place that couples go through when they break up. They have to start this life apart, and they have a lot of the same friends. It is a very relatable subject line and a heartbreaking song, but it's also lighthearted, because it's life -- and that's what we go through and what we have to deal with. From the first time we did it live, we realized we had great chemistry together on stage, so we just went with it. If the fans think that, then we're doing it right."</p><p style=text-align:justify></p><p style=text-align:justify>Well, sadly one sure cannot control,&nbsp;over the way somebody else thinks!</p><p style=text-align:justify>Additionally, Chris, who believes dating is like gambling, was previously linked with actress&nbsp;Adrianne Leon&nbsp;in the year 2007. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify></p><p style=text-align:justify>No matter what he thinks of dating, hopefully, in the future days, we will&nbsp;get to hear about Chris' actual dating affair and not just speculation, as many single ladies sure are waiting,&nbsp;fantasizing of dating this countryman.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Also, you can note down the requirements you need to have, to date Chris, as he seeks a certain quality in a girl,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>"1.You've got to be OK with staying up late, because I don't operate on the same hours as a normal person. 2. Being somebody that's OK with going to McDonald's or going to Morton's (Steakhouse). You've got to be able to do both, because sometimes I feel like one or the other. 3. You've got to have a good sense of humor. I crack jokes about stuff all the time, so that's a big thing for me. 4. You've got to be into music. 5. You've got to love going to go see a good movie."</p><p style=text-align:justify>See for yourself if you are a perfect match for Chris!</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>On Road For&nbsp;Losing Sleep Tour,&nbsp;Attends&nbsp;Route 91 Harvest Festival</h2><p style=text-align:justify>While Chris's love life is off the radar for his fans, he has not missed out on entertaining them with his music.
