They may also be a requirement in some devices.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We often suggest buying <a href=#>rechargeable AA and AAA</a> batteries, as they're much more economical than old-fashioned disposable batteries. But there are several situations where disposable batteries are preferable. In fact, some devices actually require disposable batteries.</p><h2 id=rechargeable-vs-disposable-what-s-the-difference>Rechargeable vs. Disposable: What's the Difference?</h2><p>In terms of basic usability, rechargeable and disposable AA batteries aren't all that different. They're the same shape and size, and they offer a similar capacity. So, most people use these products interchangeably.</p><p>But at a chemical level, disposable batteries are very different from rechargeable batteries. And the idea is pretty straightforward---alkaline batteries can't charge, but NiMH (nickel metal hydride) and NiCd (nickel-cadmium)&nbsp;batteries can. And, of course, alkaline batteries <a href=#>tend to leak</a> when left unattended. (Rechargeable batteries may also leak, but only when they're defective or abused.)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Still, the most important difference (for this article, at least) is the self-discharge rate of alkaline and NiMH batteries (which are the most common rechargeable AAs).</p><p>Self-discharge describes how a battery drains on its own, even when sitting on a shelf or in a drawer.&nbsp;Alkaline batteries only lose about 3% of their charge per year, so they have a fairly low self-discharge rate. But NiHM batteries lose about 1% of their charge each day. An alkaline battery can hold its charge for nearly a decade, but a rechargeable AA may empty itself after one year or less.</p><p>I should also mention disposable lithium batteries. The main selling point of lithium batteries is that they're fairly temperature resistant and can maintain a high voltage until the moment they die (alkaline batteries start to "fizzle out" as they die, which can cause problems in some electronics).&nbsp;Lithium batteries are not rechargeable. And although we will mainly discuss disposable alkaline batteries in this article, we will occasionally mention disposable lithium options.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=low-power-devices-last-longer-with-disposable-aas>Low-Power Devices Last Longer with Disposable AAs</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/a969aaab.png> Andrew Heinzman / Review Geek<p>Just a few decades ago, the vast majority of battery-powered electronics used disposable alkaline batteries. And it was an expensive pain in the neck---devices that used a lot of power, such as portable game consoles or CD players, could blow through a set of batteries after just a few hours.</p><p>These power-hungry electronics now run on built-in rechargeable batteries. It's a serious convenience, and it's an even bigger money saver.</p><p>But some new electronics, specifically low-power devices like clocks and TV remotes, still use disposable AAs and AAAs. And this is for good reason---disposable alkaline batteries have a much lower self-discharge rate than their NiMH equivalents. If a product needs to last for several months on battery power, disposable batteries are usually the best option, as they're capable of sitting around without losing their charge.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And, in some cases, you may choose to use disposable batteries in your power-hungry devices. Maybe you pick up your old Game Boy just a few times each month, for example. If you expect that Game Boy to still have a charge after sitting around, disposable batteries are your best bet. (Bear in mind that alkaline batteries will leak when left unattended for too long.)</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Do Rechargeable Batteries Actually Work?</a></span></p><p>Just to be crystal clear, disposable and rechargeable AAs tend to have a similar capacity. If you stick them both in a power-hungry device, like a Game Boy, they'll die around the same time. It's the low self-discharge rate of disposable batteries that makes them ideal for low-power electronics.</p><p>And this is really a matter of preference; if you want to avoid buying new batteries, or if you're concerned about the <a href=#>environmental impact</a> of disposable batteries, go ahead and use rechargeable AAs or AAAs in your low-power devices.

You should never mix alkaline, NiMH, or lithium batteries together. Doing so can reduce device performance, and more importantly, it can damage the batteries. Nobody wants a <a href=#>leaky alkaline battery</a>, and a damaged rechargeable battery can be a fire hazard.</p><p>But what if you don't care about safety? Well, all batteries have differing capacities and self-discharge rates. At the very least, mixing and matching is just wasteful and inconvenient. If you stick a rechargeable battery&nbsp;and a disposable battery in a TV remote, the rechargeable one will die first, and you'll be left with a half-empty alkaline battery (which you'll probably throw away).</p><p>Even if you're sticking with disposable alkaline batteries, pay attention to what you're doing. Don't mix new batteries with used batteries---this is wasteful, of course, but it may also damage the batteries, as their voltage will fluctuate as they die.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhobmhnbIFww8eepWaxn6p6tLTOrqOdpqRiwrSxjKucnKCRp7SmrcGlnGaZkWKvosDTnqminaNk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
