The taut skin that graces my forehead after a Botox injection is beginning to feel like a distant memory. I find myself singing “The Way We Were” wistfully while examining my face. “Can it be that it was all so simple then,” I wonder, “or has time rewritten every line?”</p><p>The answer is yes–and if it hasn’t yet, time will eventually rewrite every line. Naturally, I’m wondering <a href=# rel=noopener>how to make Botox and filler last longer</a> when I’m at home singing Streisand and unable to hit up my derm’s office. It’s a question of immense privilege to have at a time like this, but for those of us blessed with unrelenting vanity, a question nonetheless. So I queried the top dermatologists in New York City, expecting them to balk at my naivete. Everyone with toner in their cabinet knows that a magical at-home treatment that yields injectable-comparable results doesn’t exist.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anua-heartleaf-toner-tiktok.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/beauty-of-joseon-fi.jpg><p>Needless to say, I didn’t expect to receive a near-tome of advice from eight whipsmart skin docs. Turns out, there are real, legitimate, science-backed hacks to <a href=# rel=noopener>prolonging your Botox and filler</a> at home.

People that exercise a lot do go through their filler or toxin quicker, but there’s really no solution for that. </span><span class=s3>Try meditation or yoga to reduce stress levels, because high-stress levels release cortisol and other hormones that accelerate the aging process and rapidly enhance unwanted signs of aging.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/make-botox-la-st-zinc-image.jpg><p>“Some studies have shown that <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Botox efficacy is linked to zinc levels</a> within the body.

Products containing hyaluronic acid plump skin and can help address skin texture concerns. The plumping also mitigates the appearance of fine lines.”</span></p><p class=p2><span class=s1>“I also like at-home devices like <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Conture</a> and <a data-pmc-sp-product=d489844cc38d18d472e6856f544e185a href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"NuFace","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"NuFACE Trinity Starter Kit \u2013 Microcurrent Facial Toning Device with Hydrating Leave-On Gel Primer, 2 Fl Oz","id":"B00GG5IZWS","category":"Sets & Kits"},"id":1099552,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>NuFace</a> to help address sagging, and&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>micro-needling</a> which helps your topical products penetrate deeper. In-office, we use microneedling therapy as a minimally invasive procedure to help promote collagen production. It involves the use of a device that contains fine needles, which puncture skin to create a controlled skin injury and healing. The slight injury stimulates the growth of collagen, the scaffolding under the skin, which then improves the appearance of some scars and wrinkles. At-home micro-needling devices won’t offer the same benefits, but they can help.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/71foycavryl._sy355_.jpg><p class=p2><span class=s1>“<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">SiO Silicone Patches</a> are a great way to address specific areas of concern like crow’s feet, neck and chest lines.

Look for products loaded with glycerin to give your skin that extra boost of hydration, enhancing the effects of fillers.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Additionally, collagen-boosting ingredients such as retinols or <a href=# rel=noopener>bakuchiol (a natural retinol alternative) help firm up your skin</a> while your Botox is in full effect. Adhering to these ingredients while your Botox is in full effect not only helps promote collagen production, but also helps to minimize any residual fine lines that can’t get erased by Botox.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Finally, sunscreen is always your best bet for both healthy skin and also to help avoid unnecessary loss of your skin’s elasticity and bounce.”</span></p><h2><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Dr. Joshua Zeichner</a>, Director of Cosmetic & Clinical Research, Mount Sinai Hospital</h2><p>“Studies have shown that zinc supplements may enhance uptake of neurotoxins and give longer benefits. Taking a zinc supplement for the week before your appointment and continuing it for the week after may help.”</p><p>“There is some data suggesting that copper counteracts the effect of neurotoxins and shortens the length of their effect. While we need more information to fully understand this, you certainly can avoid eating copper-rich foods. Topical products that contain ingredients like retinol stimulate collagen and can help strengthen your skin’s foundation. The stronger the skin, the less it will experience folding and the development of lines.”</p><p>“As for fillers, some people genetically metabolize their fillers quicker than others. While it is important to exercise and stay healthy, I caution my patients against over-exercising. While completely anecdotal, I find that fillers tend not to last quite as long in my patients who engage in extreme exercise.”</p><p>“Any sort of manipulation or massage of fillers can theoretically promote early breakdown. I don’t recommend that my patients who have gotten facial fillers receive facial massages. Generally speaking, fillers tend to last longer in areas where there is less movement. For example, when injected under the eyes (in the tear troughs) or in the temples, I find that fillers can stick around for years. However, in areas such as the lips, where there is frequent movement, fillers typically do not have as much longevity.”</p><h2 class=p3><span class=s1><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Dr. Robert Anolik</a>, Laser & Skin Surgery Center of New York&nbsp;</span></h2><p class=p3><span class=s1>&nbsp;“At-h</span><span class=s1>ome skin routines have become all the more important while in-office procedures including Botox and filler are not available. Past work will be better preserved with certain steps:&nbsp;</span><span class=s1>Lean on antioxidants like vitamin E and green tea to counteract free radical damage on the skin. M</span><span class=s1>oisturizers rich in ceramides and hyaluronic acid minimize the effects of dry indoor air. Dry air leads to dry skin and inflammation and rougher texture.”</span></p><p class=p2><span class=s1>“Be consistent with your retinols at night. As we are not going outside as much, cold and windy air is not exacerbating the dryness, so if you are consistent with moisturizer at home you’ll likely <a href=# rel=noopener>tolerate a nightly retinol routine</a> if you couldn’t beforehand.”</span></p><p class=p2><span class=s1>“Consider at-home light and laser technologies, like those made by <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Tria</a>. While these are not as powerful as in-office lasers, consistent low energy use can be beneficial.”</span></p><p class=p2><span class=s1>“Still <a href=# rel=noopener>wear your sunscreen</a> while indoors. Even though we are not out and about with direct sunlight, UVA still passes through windows and can cause sun damage if not wearing sunscreen.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Good skincare and sun protection are key while we don’t have access to more invasive procedures like injectables and laser. </span><span class=s1><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Alternatives for wrinkle reducers</a> (like Botox, Xeomin, etc) are products that contain </span><span class=s4>Diaminobutyroyl Benzylamide Diacetate–an ingredient developed to mimic a molecule f</span><span class=s1>ound in snake venom.

The results from dermal filler such as <a href=# id=auto-tag_juvederm data-tag=juvederm>Juvederm</a> are apparent immediately, with the full effect seen after two weeks. Filler lasts anywhere from six to 24 months depending on the type of filler: Juvederm is 12 months, Vollure is 18 months, and Voluma is 24 months. However, different fillers last different amounts of time for different people. For patients that recently had their Botox and Juvederm treatments, they should be good for at least four months.”</span></p><p class=p2><span class=s3>“Take this time to focus on skin health, hydrate, eat healthily, not smoke, relieve stress and use products such as the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">SkinMedica line</a> from Allergan with free shipping.
