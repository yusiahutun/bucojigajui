And if you’re a lover of football, you know you feel the exact same way about your team. Lots of straight men enjoy teasing us girls for loving astrology, but have they ever considered that they believe in football just as much as we believe in the stars? <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Every zodiac sign has an NFL team</a> that captures their personality and competitive edge, which is why I’ve teamed up with my fantasy football-loving fiancé Zack Staab to give you all the details before the 2023 season officially begins on September 7.</p><p>If you never thought American football had something in common with astrology, think again. In astrology, one looks to upcoming planetary positions and their historical significations to predict what happens in the future. And <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>in fantasy football</a>, one studies and tracks NFL stats in order to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>predict which players will dominate</a> and the imaginary teams that will win. And although one is an ancient language of the cosmos and the other is a sport amongst men, they both can be considered a form of divination. Because the culture of the NFL is all about making bets, astrology can also be used to predict which teams will win and how the game unfolds for each player. Many astrologers have made sports predictions their career focus, such as John Frawley.</p><p>Are you ready for the astrology girlfriend and football boyfriend crossover that will heal our nation? Here’s the NFL team that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">captures each zodiac sign</a> the most:</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=the-nfl-team-that-captures-each-zodiac-sign>The NFL Team That Captures Each Zodiac Sign</h2><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.5><h2>Aries: The Kansas City Chiefs</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1628105845.jpg><p>There’s no denying that the Kansas City Chiefs and their quarterback Patrick Mahomes are currently dominating the NFL world. When they finally broke through a 50-year-long drought and won the 2020 Super Bowl for the first time since 1970, victory became associated with this team’s name once again, reinstating their fire for finishing in first place. Aries is the most action-packed, super-charged, and combative zodiac sign of them all, making it a perfect fit for the 2023 Super Bowl champions. After all, Aries is ruled by Mars, the god of war, and they never walk away from a challenge.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Taurus: The San Francisco 49ers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1645491896.jpg><p>Taurus is nothing if not persistent, and when this practical and patient earth sign catches a winning streak, there’s no telling how long it’ll last. The San Francisco 49ers embrace the same mindset as a Taurus, as they won five Super Bowl championships between 1981 and 1994, making them one of the most established and successful teams. Plus, the moniker “49ers” is a reference to the California gold rush of 1849, and because Taurus is ruled by rich and luxurious Venus, this zodiac sign can relate to the desire for wealth and glory.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Gemini: The Philadelphia Eagles</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1467159229.jpg><p>Gemini is nothing if not clever, and just when no one suspects them, they surprise us all with a cunning swerve. The Philadelphia Eagles dominate the game with the same sharp and mercurial spirit, as this NFL team is famous for the “Philly Special”, a risky touchdown pass that helped quarterback Nick Foles nail a Super Bowl victory in 2018. This team also has an incredibly loud and fun-loving fan base, as Gemini is one of the most social and community-oriented zodiac signs. The fact that Gemini is an air sign also tracks, as this team’s fight song is literally “Fly, Eagles Fly”.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Cancer: The Pittsburg Steelers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1644565188.jpg><p>If any NFL team is famous for establishing a powerful line of defense, it’s the Pittsburgh Steelers. In fact, they’re often referred to as the “Steel Curtain,” as nothing can break through their armor. Cancer is famous for being a highly protective zodiac sign, as this passionate water sign is symbolized by the crab, a creature that claws at predators before disappearing into the safety of their shell. Plus, Cancer is the most family oriented zodiac sign of all and the Steelers have been owned by the Rooney family—yes, the family of Rooney Mara and Kate Mara—since its inception in 1933.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4><h2>Leo: The Dallas Cowboys</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1458917352.jpg><p>The NFL team that calls themselves “America’s Team” would have to be a Leo. After all, Leo is one of the most prideful, theatrical, and heroic zodiac signs, making them Dallas Cowboys the classic “main character” of the NFL world. Aside from having the highest overall winning percentage in the entire NFL, this team loves the cameras, as their television presence has broken records, making them the most popular team in 15 states, including California. Plus, their cheerleaders are famous for their legendary performances that always rile up the crowd.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Virgo: The Los Angeles Rams</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1441712437.jpg><p>After clinching the Super Bowl championship in 2021, the Los Angeles Rams are making a scene in the NFL world once again. Beyond the workmanship and discipline this team is known for, they’ve proven themselves as a team that can adapt to changing circumstances, much like mutable earth sign Virgo. Between their early years in Cleveland, their hay day in St. Louis, and their current home in Los Angeles, the Rams have stayed true to their spirit and loyal to the fan base that follows them wherever they go. Virgo is also one of the cleanest and most eco-friendly zodiac signs and the Rams’ focus on sustainability and reducing their carbon footprint makes them more than unique.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Libra: The Las Vegas Raiders</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1613564907.jpg><p>Libra is the most suave and fashion-forward rockstar of the zodiac. And if we’re being honest, the Las Vegas Raiders have the coolest uniform colors and the most gritty style of play. This team is more than just a brute force, but a full-blown vibe as the league’s resident bad ass. Plus, this is a team that attracts misfits that come together for their shared love of the silver and black. You may not see Libra as much of a fighter, but you forget that Libra is also the zodiac sign of Justice. They were the first NFL team to hire a Black coach (Art Shell) and a woman as CEO (Amy Trask). The Raiders are a team for people who root passionately for the underdog, knowing that they’re bound to balance the scales with their fourth Super Bowl win in no time.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Scorpio: The New Orleans Saints</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1612876886.jpg><p>Some NFL teams pass through cities, but the Saints have always belonged to the haunted and historical city of New Orleans. The loyalty ascribed to the Saints is beautiful and downright terrifying, as their fan base roots for their team with the same level of passion and commitment as a Scorpio. Victory is always an incredibly emotional and transformative experience for a Scorpio. The Saints are associated with the “Miracle in the Superdome,” otherwise known as their 2006 victory during their first home game since Hurricane Katrina annihilated their city. Scorpio is a zodiac sign that can overcome all odds, coming up from rock bottom all the way up to NFL champions. Scorpio is nothing if not resilient.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Sagittarius: The Cincinnati Bengals</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1460295461.jpg><p>When the Cincinnati Bengals are playing, you know the party is just getting started. This city takes football very seriously, as it brings the community together through their passion for tail-gaiting culture and pre-gaming. With their iconic and eye-catching black and orange stripes, the Bengals have a free-spirited vibe that screams Sagittarius. The fan base literally shouts “Cin-cin-att-i, beep bop boop” during each game. Need I say more? This zodiac sign is not only in the mood to get wild and risky, but its also famous for an expansive and open-minded mentality. After all, the Bengals have a long tradition of producing some of the most storied wide receivers in the league.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Capricorn: The New England Patriots</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1422877152-1.jpg><p>Capricorn is the zodiac sign of discipline, leadership, and authority, making it a clear connection to the New England Patriots. This iconic NFL team is known for their rigorous work ethic and the mentorship of Bill Bellicheck, who is arguably the greatest coach in American football history. With their “do your job” mentality, this team is run much like a militant force, as they developed a stronghold over the Super Bowl with legendary quarterback Tom Brady and currently hold 11 Super Bowl wins. Their consistent domination over the sport has earned them the reputation of being a modern-day dynasty. If any zodiac sign is gonna work their way up to football royalty, it’s Capricorn.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>Aquarius: The Green Bay Packers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1649010355.jpg><p>Aquarius is one of the most progressive and community-oriented zodiac signs of all. They are the first to rebel against authority and rail against the idea of having one all-powerful leader. The Green Bay Packers resonates with this sentiment, as they are the only publicly-owned team with more than 360,000 shareholders collectively owning stock. It’s no wonder the Green Bay Packers are the first team to sell out a stadium and their commitment to individuality is what has allowed them to produce the most MVP winners in the league. And because Aquarius is always willing to be eccentric, it captures the way their fan base literally calls themselves “Cheeseheads”.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.8834688346883><h2>Pisces: The Chicago Bears</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1644742975.jpg><p>Pisces is the most ancient and wise zodiac sign, as it is the last sign in the zodiac wheel. The Chicago Bears are equally as historic of a team, as they were founded in 1920, making them one of the oldest in the NFL. And with nine NFL championships and one Super Bowl victory under their belt, the NFL simply wouldn’t be the same without their presence on the field. Because Pisces is also the zodiac sign of imagination and creative self-expression, the Bears are also famous for their 1985 “Super Bowl Shuffle” in which every player celebrated their Super Bowl win by <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>broadcasting their dance and rapping skills</a> for all the world to see. Pisces is nothing if not clever and adorable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfr7yltcCcZKyhl6PAbrrFpWSfp5%2Bpr6K4y2arnpmdZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
