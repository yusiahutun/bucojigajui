They were the words of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/a40197731/queen-style-legacy-video/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="a woman with a keen awareness of what clothes meant" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">a woman with a keen awareness of what clothes meant</a>. Fashion, to the late Queen, was not frivolous – nor was it an insignificant part of her job. Quite the contrary; the monarch knew that what you wear matters, and when you are a public figure of such magnitude, it matters very much. Still now, a year after her death, her outfits remain a memorable and a much-loved part of her image.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Over the seven decades of her reign, Her Majesty became a style <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a40007414/the-queen-cultural-icon/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=icon class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">icon</a>, but not necessarily because she set or even followed trends. Instead, she weaponised clothing. Getting dressed, as the Queen, meant marrying two complicated impulses: the desire to dress as oneself (her cherished countryside pragmatism) and the awareness that your personal expression must, in a way, be secondary to the role you fulfil – clothes loaded with symbolic weight. The Queen’s unflinching sense of individual sacrifice and her awareness that she was, first and foremost, a public servant, played out in how she dressed.</p><img alt="queen elizabeth fashion" title="queen elizabeth fashion" width=569 height=594 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/queen-elizabeth-ii-on-the-balcony-of-government-house-news-photo-1662996173.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Fox Photos</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for The Queen's royal fashion through the decades" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/q-1599220499.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In this way, the Queen’s clothes were both costume and symbol. She would incorporate colours, motifs and accessories which spoke to the event she was attending, the head of state she was meeting or the nation she was visiting. Her use of colour allowed her to stand out – not only bringing joy to those who met her, but actually making it easier for those who had often travelled far to do so, to pick her out of the crowd. She would be bold when required, tempered when reflecting a national mood, or practical when the occasion called for it. She was stylish, polished and elegant to a fault, and never without forethought. The Queen wore nothing by accident.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For the length of her extraordinary reign, Her Majesty was also often the only female head of state and she spent many years – especially at the beginning of her tenure – as a solitary woman in a sea of men. Inheriting the crown from her father in the still very patriarchal landscape of the 1950s, one would forgive her for somehow quashing her femininity – modelling herself on an image of a powerful leader as embodied by a male aesthetic. Instead, she did quite the opposite. From her earliest ruling years to the final pictures we have of her, just last week, she was unapologetically feminine. It was a subtle yet empowering statement.</p><img alt="queen elizabeth fashion" title="queen elizabeth fashion" width=1765 height=2475 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/queen-elizabeth-ii-watches-her-horse-fabricate-run-in-the-news-photo-1662996006.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Max Mumby/Indigo</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The style legacy of the Queen is a simple lesson in the power of fashion. She was a woman who knew she was herself a symbol, and adopted a classic yet iconic uniform to communicate this: pearls, hats, block colours – that Launer London top-handle bag. Hers was a role whose influence and relevance were so often under fire in an ever-changing political landscape and yet she knew, from the moment she made that famous address on her 21st birthday, that she would devote her life to offering stability and reassurance to Great Britain and the Commonwealth – and so she dressed the part. She was not just a style icon, she was the embodiment of something bigger than herself; a living symbol.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="body-h2 css-12zwj0s emevuu60"><strong>1940s…</strong></p><img alt="1945 princess elizabeth, standing by an auxiliary territorial service first aid truck wearing an officers uniform photo by keystonegetty images" title="Princess Elizabeth" width=3102 height=2889 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-3318448-1662986559.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Keystone</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Princess and heir apparent, the young Elizabeth was already dressing with one eye on personal style and the other on duty. She wore many uniforms in this regard, not least the actual uniform of a serving woman in the armed forces during the war. In 1944, aged 18, the Princess Elizabeth enlisted in the Auxiliary Territorial Service, without any preferential treatment, and qualified as a mechanic. During this time, she was frequently seen in her military uniform, and her ‘off duty’ looks were both feminine and practical, as befit a young woman who once said that she longed only to marry a farmer and “have lots of cows, horses, dogs and children”.</p><img alt="queen elizabeth prince philip wedding day" title="queen elizabeth prince philip wedding day" width=2202 height=2817 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-2636196-1662986650.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Hulton Archive</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She matched the public mood in her dressing at this time – austere and down-to-earth – and this was even reflected in her most public dress yet: her wedding gown. It was bought, as any other post-war bride would have had to, with ration coupons.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>1950s…</strong></h2><img alt="queen elizabeth ii" title="Queen Elizabeth II " width=2341 height=2945 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/london-england-queen-elizabeth-ii-26-years-young-is-news-photo-1662735472.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Bettmann</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It was the decade in which the young princess came to the throne – far sooner than anyone had expected. Churchill famously remarked, upon the death of King George VI, that the new Queen was, at 25, “only a child”. While she still maintained her hallmarks – feminine silhouettes, pearls and her trademark hairstyle – there may have been an impulse in the young Queen to prove her worth and maturity, as her fashion reflected this shift in her status.</p><img alt="queen elizabeth coronation gown" title="queen elizabeth coronation gown" width=2718 height=3292 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-3422058-1662987056.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Central Press</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><img alt="queen elizabeth fashion" title="queen elizabeth fashion" width=3776 height=4648 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/queen-elizabeth-ii-wears-a-slim-fitting-white-lace-dress-to-news-photo-1662996059.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Keystone</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During this time, the Queen’s style, naturally, took an increasingly regal direction. Gone were many of the austere looks of her war and post-war fashion, replaced with white gloves, an abundance of accessories and jewellery, and the full skirts and nipped-in-waists that were the dominating aesthetic of the period. Throughout, she was never unaware of the power of what she wore to convey a message. Into her Norman Hartnell coronation dress were embroidered all the floral emblems of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth, of which she was now sovereign.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>1960s…</strong></h2><img alt="queen elizabeth ii and prince philip in delhi during a state visit to india, 21st january 1961 photo by fox photoshulton archivegetty images" title="State Drive In Delhi" width=4160 height=4118 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-51313427-1662987474.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Fox Photos</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The mini-skirts and barefoot hippie looks of the swinging sixties may not have been entirely reflected in the Queen’s own fashion, but here, we saw Her Majesty experiment more with colour – specifically block colours and pastels (and even leopard print) – and changing shapes, like frock coats and shorter hemlines.</p><img alt="queen elizabeth ii with us president richard nixon 1913 1994, followed by princes charles left and philip, at buckingham palace, london, 25th february 1969 photo by john olsongetty images" title="Nixon European trip" width=1365 height=2048 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-474389363-1662987574.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Olson</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It is the decade which saw the first inklings of what would become her style signatures: her structured skirt suits, pearls and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a40537625/queen-elizabeth-brooches-exhibit-windsor-castle-2022/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=brooches class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">brooches</a>.

The calling cards of her style, developed before, but perfected in the 1960s, were merely tweaked during the 1970s. Here, Her Majesty embraced the shifting palette of the time, exploring slightly more muted tones, like greens, mustards and browns, and the William Morris revival florals that became so popular. She also took to shirt dresses and capes.</p><img alt="queen elizabeth fashion" title="queen elizabeth fashion" width=4265 height=4262 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-631467293-1662987898.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Hulton Archive</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><img alt="queen elizabeth fashion" title="queen elizabeth fashion" width=1914 height=2744 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/queen-elizabeth-ll-arrives-at-aberdeen-airport-with-her-news-photo-1662996143.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Anwar Hussein</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What remained unwavering, however, was her commitment to communication through dress. In 1977, during a royal tour of New Zealand, she famously wore a Māori cloak over an orange skirt suit. On a visit to Saudi Arabia, in 1979, she wore a longer skirt in deep red – a colour of deep significance in the region – and wore one of Australia’s national colours, yellow, during her stay there in 1970.</p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>1980s…</strong></h2><img alt="queen elizabeth fashion" title="queen elizabeth fashion" width=5291 height=3502 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1662988085.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Shelley Collection/Avalon</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><img alt="queen elizabeth fashion" title="queen elizabeth fashion" width=2126 height=3044 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/queen-elizabeth-ii-and-prince-philip-duke-of-edinburgh-news-photo-1662997763.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Anwar Hussein</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It was the decade in which the Queen became a grandmother.

It was a decade which contained her infamous annus horriblus – in which three of her children divorced and there was a seismic fire at Windsor Castle – and also, of course, the decade which saw the tragic death of Diana; a moment in which the Queen was met with hostility and plunging popularity for the first time. Yet it was during this time that Her Majesty began her now famous rainbow wheel of bold, block-colour dressing. She was becoming a symbol more than ever, at a moment when the popularity of the monarchy was at its most vulnerable.</p><h2 data-node-id=46 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>2000s…</strong></h2><img alt="egham, united kingdom july 11 embargoed for publication in uk newspapers until 24 hours after create date and time queen elizabeth ii attends the out sourcing inc royal windsor cup polo match and a carriage driving display by the british driving society at guards polo club, smith's lawn on july 11, 2021 in egham, england photo by max mumbyindigogetty images" title="Queen Elizabeth II Attends The Royal Windsor Cup 2021" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/queen-elizabeth-style-1662995663.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Max Mumby/Indigo</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bold colours, great hats, pearls, brooches, tweed skirts, black handbags. For the last two decades of her reign, the Queen maintained a clear standard in her uniform, one which showed her unswerving dedication to her life of public service at a time of turmoil – both global and personal. It was during this period that she lost her beloved mother and sister, and, more recently, her "strength and stay", her husband Prince Philip. The image of the Queen, a mourning widow, sat alone at his funeral, wearing a black face mask due to Covid restrictions, will perhaps be one of the most enduring illustrations of her commitment to her people.
