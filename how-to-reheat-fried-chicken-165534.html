And let’s face it, crispy drumsticks, breasts, and thighs are good no matter what method you use to reheat leftover fried chicken. With that said, there are a few techniques and tips that will help you reheat fried chicken so it <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">stays crispy.&nbsp;</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to Reheat Fried Chicken in the Oven</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/how-to-reheat-fried-chicken-so-it-stays-crispy.jpg><p class=caption style=text-align:center>(Photo Credit: HelloFresh)</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>The oven is definitely the preferred method if you want to reheat crispy fried chicken, and the experts agree. Chef Thomas Boemer of <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">Revival</a> restaurant says the best way to reheat fried chicken without drying it out is to place the leftover fried chicken on a baking rack tented with aluminum foil and reheat in a 300 degree Fahrenheit oven. “The tenting prevents the crust from darkening, and it also prevents the chicken from drying out,” he explains.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re thinking about trying this method, you might be wondering how long to reheat fried chicken in the oven. <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">HelloFresh</a> chef, Claudia Sidoti, says to expect this process to take around 30 minutes. But, it’s relatively simple and what you end up with is crispy fried chicken that’s warm on the inside. Here, Sidoti shares her expert <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">steps to reheat</a> fried chicken in the oven.&nbsp;</p><li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.</li><li>Take the fried chicken out of the refrigerator and set on the counter while the oven preheats. This will allow all of the pieces to reach a similar internal temperature.</li><li>Place the chicken on an oven-safe baking sheet lined with aluminum foil.&nbsp;</li><li>Place the pan in the oven on the center rack for about 10 minutes.</li><li>Make sure to check on the chicken frequently, as they may heat at different speeds.</li><p>As a general rule, Sidoti says that thicker pieces will heat at a slower rate than smaller pieces. But, if the chicken is crispy on the outside and warm all the way through, they’re done.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to Reheat Fried Chicken in the Microwave</h2><p>Microwaves are best known for being the “go to” <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">kitchen tool</a> when time is tight. While this is not Sidoti’s preferred method, she knows that many people need to use the microwave in a pinch. That said, if you go this route, be aware that the fried chicken tends to dry out the already soggy skin as it cooks. “This will result in a soft, soggy texture that won’t compare to the crisp skin you can achieve when reheated properly,” she explains. However, Sidoti says that if you’re in a pinch, follow these steps for reheating fried chicken in the <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">microwave</a>.&nbsp;</p><li>Take your fried chicken out of the refrigerator and allow it to sit out for 10 minutes, so it approaches room temperature. This is done for almost all methods of reheating to prevent chicken from losing moisture during the heating.</li><li>Place a paper towel over the plate to help the chicken avoid getting too soggy. The towel will take in some of the moisture.&nbsp;</li><li>Microwave the fried chicken in 30-second intervals until warm. Be careful not to over-microwave or it’ll dry out.</li><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to Reheat Fried Chicken in a Toaster Oven</h2><p>When it comes to the best way to reheat leftover fried chicken, the oven and toaster oven are neck and neck for first place.

Remove the plate from the microwave and place the chicken on the baking sheet.&nbsp;</li><li>Stick the baking sheet in the toaster oven for about two to three additional minutes.&nbsp;</li><li>Let the chicken stand until just about lukewarm to touch.&nbsp;</li><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to Reheat Frozen Fried Chicken&nbsp;</h2><p>You worked hard to whip up some homemade fried chicken, so the last thing you want to do is toss out the leftovers.
