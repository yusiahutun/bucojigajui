We’re not here to hurt you,'” Huskins said. “And in that moment, I just thought, ‘Oh my God. This is not a dream.'”</p><p>She continued, “I heard him drive off. I <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1050082/infinity-politician-gypsy-rose-blanchard-clue/>slowly counted to 10.</a> I peeled the tape off my eyes and I was by myself in this alleyway,” she said. The kidnapper, who had taken Huskins’ bags when he abducted her, had removed them from the car and placed them on the ground. “I grabbed my bags and started walking down that alley … and I looked at the corner street name and I saw Utica, which is the street that I grew up on.” She was held hostage for two days and was sexually assaulted in Lake Tahoe before being returned to her hometown of Huntington Beach, California.</p><p>While she was kidnapped, Quinn contacted the police even though the kidnappers told him that they would kill her if he did. The case happened while Gone Girl was on its way to becoming a cultural phenomenon—which made police think that Quinn was making the story up and questioned him for more than a week as well as Huskins when she returned.</p><p>However, Matthew Muller, a Gulf War veteran and Harvard-educated attorney was behind the kidnapping. Authorities said they found a cellphone that they traced to Muller and a subsequent search of a car and home turned up evidence, including a computer Muller stole from Quinn. However, it did not account for the amount of<a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lifestyle/lifestyle/506470/best-true-crime-books/> damage and trauma</a> that Quinn and Huskins endured during their time with officials.</p><p>Vallejo police apologized for initially discounting the couple’s story. In 2018, Huskins and Quinn reached a $2.5 million settlement with the city. Muller pleaded guilty to federal kidnapping charges and was sentenced in 2017 to 40 years in prison.&nbsp;</p><p>So where is Denise Huskins now after the case?

Denise Huskins currently lives with her husband Aaron Quinn and their two daughters.</p><p>In anticipation of the new <a href=# id=auto-tag_netflix data-tag=netflix>Netflix</a> documentary coming out, she posted on her <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.instagram.com/p/C1sw_Qnx4rI/?hl=en">Instagram account</a>, “I can’t believe it’s coming so soon. It’s been a long journey to get here, especially in finding the right team to share our story.” She continued, “Tune in on Jan 17th, and you’ll see this is not “just another True Crime.” This goes way beyond just us as victims, and this one case.</p><p>The bigger themes of rushing to judgement, victim blaming, misrepresentation in the media, false accusations fueled by tunnel vision and confirmation bias in law enforcement, and the dangerous tactics they use to try to get a false confession, are sadly all too common in our world. But perhaps more importantly, it’s a story of hope when all feels lost. I believe anyone who’s overcome a trauma can connect with different parts of this series and what we went through. We look forward to having you watch. ❤️🙏🏻”</p><p>Both Huskins and Quinn have been very vocal about their experiences, with the two writing a book called Victim F: From Crime Victims to Suspects to Survivors. “There were things that happened that we saw, that we heard. It just would have been impossible to have been done by one guy,” Huskins said to ABC 7. “There are other people out there. That’s something that we’ve had to live with and somehow make peace with.”</p><p><strong>American Nightmare is now available to stream on Netflix.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image.png><p>In&nbsp;<a data-pmc-sp-product=b932cb0ce74f713da1990e24b944ffef href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Victim F","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Victim F: From Crime Victims to Suspects to Survivors","price":"18.50","id":"0593099966","category":"Memoirs"},"id":1701867,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Victim F</a> , Aaron and Denise recount the horrific ordeal that almost cost them everything. Like too many victims of sexual violence, they were dismissed, disbelieved, and dragged through the mud. With no one to rely on except each other, they took on the victim blaming, harassment, misogyny, and abuse of power running rife in the criminal justice system. Their story is, in the end, a love story, but one that sheds necessary light on sexual assault and the abuse by law enforcement that all too frequently compounds crime victims’ suffering.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
