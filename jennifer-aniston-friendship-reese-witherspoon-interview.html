I get really excited about work, so I get tons of nervous energy,” Witherspoon tells Harper’s Bazaar for her August cover story. “I’m kind of a high-strung person.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her friends, full of admiration for her, entirely agree.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I don’t have it in me to do what she does,” her Morning Show costar Julianna Margulies says. “Reese somehow manages to compartmentalize—and she’s good at being in charge.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Witherspoon has previously described herself as having the energy of “a squirrel who drank coffee,” but Big Little Lies costar Laura Dern has a kinder perspective on her close friend.

I was really nervous, and she was like, ‘Oh, my gosh—don’t worry about it!’ I marveled at her ability to perform in front of a live audience like that with no nerves. They would change all the lines and she was just so effortlessly affable, bubbly, and sunny.
