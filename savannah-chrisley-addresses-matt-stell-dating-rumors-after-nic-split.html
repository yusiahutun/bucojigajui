You got to date to know where you got to land.”</p><p>Chrisley also admitted that <a href=#>she never watched the music video</a>, which starred her and Kerdiles, 28. “I don’t even like to hear the song anymore. You can’t take people you’re in a relationship with to your favorite restaurants, your favorite vacation spots because then you might break up and it ruins it,” she explained.</p><p>Viewers of <a href=#>Chrisley Knows Best</a> were introduced to Kerdiles <a href=#>after he started dating the Georgia native</a> in November 2017. The pair, who met on Instagram, got engaged in April 2019 <a href=#>but later decided to postpone their wedding.</a></p><p>“We made [the decision] together. We both realized that things moved way too fast and we needed to go back to dating,” the fashion designer explained on the “Chrisley Confessions” podcast in June 2020. “I just knew we had to work on things on a different level. We had to dig deeper, and it’s hard.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Three months later, Chrisley <a href=#>announced her split from the former athlete.</a>“Nic and I have decided to call it quits,” she wrote via Instagram at the time. “There’s no hatred between the two of us…and in all honesty…that makes saying goodbye even harder. We have nothing but love, respect, and admiration for one another but it’s time for us to move forward individually.”</p><p>At the time, the TV personality noted that she <a href=#>wasn’t ruling out a possible reconciliation</a>. “Nic and I, we’re on good terms. We’re both so young and ambitious, and you know, we’re trying to find our way in life,” she exclusively told Us Weekly in November 2020. “No decision is ever permanent, so you never know what can happen. We have the rest of our lives to figure things out.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasmaaWu6%2Btx2aaoaqZqLmmxYyam52qlajApr%2BMppitrF2owaa4y2abmqyZo7RuvtSmpqurXZaztbHRZqWim12ova2102g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
