He recorded as a solo artist for MCA Canada, and EMI Canada in the 1990s, and went onto to be lead vocalist for the Scottish rock band Runrig from 1998, until the group retired in 2018. He received several East Coast Music Awards, and hosted the Canadian TV show “Songwriters Circle.” Bruce was one of the reasons why I looked forward each year visiting Atlantic Canada for music industry conference while I was writing for Billboard.”</p><p>He is survived by his wife, Kim Anderson-Guthro, and two children, Jodi and Dylan Guthro.</p><br><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ4BwfJhoZ29nk5a7orDImqVmq5mjtKa%2BjKymp5%2Bnp7a1sdFmmautk5p6qMHToamoZZSarqV5wK1kb2pf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
