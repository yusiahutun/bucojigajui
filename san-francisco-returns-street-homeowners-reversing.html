Representative Nancy Pelosi and Senator Dianne Feinstein both used to call the street home.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">Sales like this happen every day to all kinds of people and businessesAaron Peskin, San Francisco Board of Supervisors</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And yet San Francisco’s ultra elite have had no end of trouble paying a tiny tax on the palm trees, pavement and shrubbery within their gated cul-de-sac.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The neighbourhood association first defaulted on the street in the 1970s, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. It got the title back in 1985 – and then immediately fell into arrears again.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The residents had forgotten to give the city their new accountant’s address, the Chronicle reported, and so never saw their US$14 annual tax bill.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The city, meanwhile, kept sending the bill to the bounced address, year after year and into the 21st century – until Presidio Terrace racked up US$994 in outstanding taxes and fees.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Accordingly, it ended up on an auction list in early 2015.</p>Presidio’s fancy palm tree and guarded street got no special treatment in this process; they were simply listed as a vacant lot, the Chronicle wrote. Lam, a Silicon Valley software manager who immigrated from Hong Kong, and husband Cheng, a Taiwanese immigrant, bid US$90,000 for the land, and the city’s Board of Supervisors approved the sale along with 549 others in a single, unanimous vote.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/11/30/84c935b2-d56a-11e7-93d7-6d6fc14be448_1320x770_093453.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For the next two years, no one on Presidio Terrace even noticed their street had been sold.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This situation changed abruptly in May, Horton wrote, when a representative for the new landowners asked the residents if they wanted to buy their street back.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I was shocked to learn this could happen and am deeply troubled that anyone would choose to take advantage of the situation and buy our street and sidewalks,” an anonymous homeowner told the Chronicle in August, after the neighbourhood association sued the couple and appealed to the city to reverse the sale.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The residents complained that the city never notified them they were in danger of tax default, other than sending mail to the wrong address. Their lawyer accused Lam and Cheng of essentially extorting them – and trying “to exploit a bureaucratic oversight to their advantage.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The city’s tax collector pointed out that Presidio’s residents were treated the same as any other tax delinquents. His office had posted notice of their default on its website and in newspapers, and sent certified mail to the address the residents had supplied.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But as the battle to come would demonstrate, the residents of Presidio Terrace were not your average tax delinquents.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The well-heeled homeowners of San Francisco’s Presidio Terrace neighbourhood are assembling quite the army to help them win back the private street they lost to a South Bay couple,” the Chronicle wrote in September, after residents hired several former city officials to lobby the city.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Senator Feinstein wrote a letter to the city in October on her former neighbours’ behalf. She felt “personal empathy” for the residents, she wrote, but insisted her objection to the sale had nothing to do with that history.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In the United States, no one should lose property at the hands of the government without knowing it,” Feinstein wrote.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And so on Tuesday, the elected Board of Supervisors that governs San Francisco did something it had never done before and held a vote to reverse a tax sale from two years before.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Not everyone on the board was sympathetic to the residents. “Sales like this happen every day to all kinds of people and businesses,” supervisor Aaron Peskin told the Chronicle.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The city’s tax assessor wasn’t swayed either. He told the supervisors that more than 10,000 bills are sent to wrong addresses every year, and yet most of those people manage to pay their back taxes before they lose their property.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Presidio, meanwhile, had failed for 30 years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This stinks of entitlement, unless of course you hold hearings for every homeowner or group who has their property auctioned off for non-payment of taxes,” one resident wrote to the board, according to CNN.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But a majority of the board sided with the residents and against the couple.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lam and Cheng presented themselves as a working couple who merely wanted to invest in San Francisco.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After voting to take the street from them, Mark Farrell called the couple “speculators … attempting to extort San Francisco residents that I represent into a quick US$1 million payday,” according to the Chronicle.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So the residents of Presidio Terrace will get yet another chance to pay their taxes and keep their street.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And “the speculators get their money back,” Farrell told the Chronicle. “No harm, no foul.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is unclear how Cheng and his wife will get their money back.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The law should be fair for everyone,” Cheng told reporters after the vote.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to the Chronicle, he and his wife plan to sue to get it back.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miuqKqcmXy2usitnJ1lo6mutbHSZpqappGZrnCt0a2gnKSVZH9yfpFqcHFno5a7brLRmqWcoaOYvG6%2BxK2sq6ajYsC1vsSeq2agn6KysMPNnqmsZaKaw6a%2B0qKloA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
