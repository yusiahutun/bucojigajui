Named after Halliwell’s 1991 solo chart-topper, the horse won a hunter chase at Newbury on his debut under Rules.</p><p>Their charge had to stave off competition from the last fence but did so emphatically as Lift Me Up went on to win by a length, to the delight of the Horners - winning £2,361 in prize money. “It’s an amazing performance. James rode a great race but Maxine and Natasha did a wonderful, wonderful job,” the elated racing supremo told <a href=# rel=nofollow>Racing TV</a>.</p><p><b>READ MORE: <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Toto Wolff trolls 'obsessed' Christian Horner and says 'I live in his head rent free'</a></b></p><p>“It’s supposed to be a weekend off for me. It’s great to see him run so well. He’s obviously got a lot of potential which is exciting to see. He’s a lovely horse, so we are very proud to have him. He’s a gentle giant.” He continued: “It’s my first time ever at Newbury. What a lovely venue, so to get a winner under Rules is wonderful."</p><p>Geri added: “We both love horses and we are happy hackers. I bought a horse for Christian who was an ex-racehorse and said ‘Why don’t we try and get a point-to-pointer?’ This was the first time he has run under Rules. It’s amazing. When we saw that rainbow we thought it was a sign.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article29535770.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/3_Geri-and-Christian-Horner-with-the-point-to-point-winner-Lift-Me-Up.jpg><p>Maxine Filby, Life Me Up’s trainer, was appointed to her role at the Horners’ stables near Banbury, Oxfordshire last year. “There is nervous excitement,” Filby said about the horse previously.</p><p>“This is quite a jump in class but this will be an experience over bigger fences because he has qualified for the Intermediate Final at Cheltenham at the track’s hunter chase evening. We will see how he gets on.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article29535769.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Geri-and-Christian-Horner-with-the-point-to-point-winner-Lift-Me-Up.jpg><p>The Horners, both equestrian lovers, enjoyed their first success as owners when Lift Me Up won at Mollington in May 2022 under Hannah Henn. “He is named after my song, which went to No 1, and now he has gone to No 1,” said Geri at the time.</p><p>Commenting on why they love horses, Horner told <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Telegraph</a> earlier this month: "Honestly, it's just a bit of fun. We don't really know what we're doing but it's exciting. It's something Geri and I both get a kick out of, and something we enjoy as a family."</p><p>Horner's passion for the horses began when he rode ponies at home as a youngster in Warwickshire.</p><p><b>READ NEXT:</b></p><ul><li><p><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Roy Keane surprised Eddie Jordan at F1 race by doing 'opposite' of other guests</a></b></p></li><li><p><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>'Michael Schumacher's wife banned pals from visiting - it's hard for Mick to cope'</a></b></p></li><li><p><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Real reason why F1 teams say 'box, box' instead of telling drivers to 'pit stop'</a></b></p></li><li><p><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>People are only just realising why Formula One cars do a formation lap</a></b></p></li><li><p><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>7 hot WAGs of F1 legend Fernando Alonso - from Russian model to Andrea Schlager</a></b></p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e8VqZpygop7AtbXAp2Shp6KjsrN5xp6pomWYpL%2B0sYyrmJyhnpx6c4WUbWxua2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
