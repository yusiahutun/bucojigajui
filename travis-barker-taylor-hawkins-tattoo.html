"Sad to write this or to never see you again."</p><p>"I'll never forget Laguna Beach days when I was a trash man playing in a punk rock band and you were playing with Alanis [Morissette]," he continued. "You'd come watch me play in dive bars and be like, 'Kid you're a star,' and I thought you were crazy but you gave me so much hope and determination."</p><p>Barker reminisced on how their respective bands had toured Australia together, and shared that he had "the best memories of smoking cigarettes in the restroom of flights we were on together and watching your set every night."</p><p>"To say I'll miss you my friend isn't enough," he concluded. "Till the next time we talk drums and smoke in the boys room ‚Ä¶ Rest In Peace üò¢ü•Åüíî."</p><p>On March 25, the Foo Fighters ‚Äî the band in which Hawkins had been a member since 1997 ‚Äî announced the heartbreaking news on social media, writing, "The Foo Fighters family is devastated by the tragic and untimely loss of our beloved Taylor Hawkins. His musical spirit and infectious laughter will live on with all of us forever."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>The statement continued, "Our hearts go out to his wife, children and family, and we ask that their privacy be treated with the utmost respect in this unimaginably difficult time."</p><p>Hawkins -- who shared three children with his wife Allison -- was a touring drummer for <a href=#><strong>Alanis Morissette</strong></a> and Sass Jordan before he joined the Foo Fighters. In addition to being a member of the <a href=#><strong>Dave Grohl</strong></a>-led rock band, Hawkins also sang and drummed in his own band, Taylor Hawkins and the Coattail Riders. Last year, Hawkins founded the supergroup NHC, which is set to release an album this year.</p><p><a href=#>TMZ</a> reported that the drummer's cause of death is still being investigated, but in a release from the Attorney General's Office in Bogot√°, Colombia, officials say a toxicology test taken from Hawkin's urine revealed 10 different substances -- including opioids, tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines.</p><p>The Foo Fighters were set to perform in Bogota, Colombia on Friday. Per the outlet, it is where Hawkins is said to have died. Hawkins last took the stage with the Foos at Lollapalooza Argentina on March 20.
