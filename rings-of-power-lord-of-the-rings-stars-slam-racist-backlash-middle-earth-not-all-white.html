"Rings" critics have taken the extra step of saying that by diversifying the cast of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth, the are going against what the other wrote or intended (which isn't true).</p><p>In a united statement shared to the show's official Twitter account, the cast writes, "We, the cast of 'Rings of Power,' stand together in absolute solidarity and against the relentless racism, threats, harassment and abuse some of our castmates of color are being subjected to on a daily basis. We refuse to ignore it or tolerate it."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:5a1418a2-a9db-4ffb-839b-b446c2ccbf7e data-container-ref=toofab:article:fd0d707a-9005-4789-b00c-829c27e8259c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/94/5by4/2022/08/23/9499ca437dc74eaaa040678fd0a7cccb_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Bravo 'Shocked and Appalled' by Racist Bullying Aimed at Garcelle Beauvais' 14-Year-Old Son</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p lang=en dir=ltr>We stand in solidarity with our cast. <a href=#>#YouAreAllWelcomeHere</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/HLIQdyqLmr</a></p>— The Lord of the Rings on Prime (@LOTRonPrime) <a href=#>September 7, 2022</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@LOTRonPrime</a><p>Pushing back against the specific criticisms about Tolkien's lore and intent, the statement reminded these so-called "fans" that he "created a world which, by definition, is multi-cultural. A world in which free peoples from different races and cultures join together, in fellowship, to defeat the forces of evil."</p><p>"Our world has never been all white, fantasy has never been all white, Middle-earth is not all white," the statement continued. "BIPOC belong in Middle-earth and they are here to stay."</p><p>The cast continued by giving a shout-out and expressing their thanks to those fans that have supported the project. They also acknowledged "fans of colour who are themselves being attacked simply for existing in the fandom."</p><p>They praised their visibility, their bravery, incredible cosplay, fan art and engagement with the rich world Tolkien put on the page and Peter Jackson brought to stunning live in his early 2000s film trilogy.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:403f862d-d537-454f-9101-049520abe72b data-container-ref=toofab:article:fd0d707a-9005-4789-b00c-829c27e8259c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/20/5by4/2022/08/24/20cc1f46000447dfa0556485c1e18381_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">SiriusXM/Everett Collection</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">John Boyega Reflects on Racist Star Wars Fans And Why He's In No Rush to Return as Finn</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Three of the stars of that trilogy came together to share their support for this next generation of stars to step into Middle-earth. Elijah Wood, Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan, who all portrayed hobbits in the original trilogy and have remained close friends in the two decades since, made their statement both visually and with words.</p><p>They captioned an image shared to Wood's Twitter feed with the message, "You are all welcome here." They are each wearing custom-designed t-shirts featuring the various ear shapes of Middle-earth's denizens in a wide array of skin tones.</p><p>Above this striking and powerful image is the phrase in Elvish (Sí de maedyl) which translates more directly to "You All Are Welcome Here." The t-shirts are available for purchase through <a href=#>Don Marshall</a>, also as hoodies and in other styles, including a hat shared by Sean Astin to his own Twitter feed with the same message, with half of proceeds going to a charity that supports POC.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:804d4ed8-e6a9-4891-9d2c-494d8d6125b7 data-container-ref=toofab:article:fd0d707a-9005-4789-b00c-829c27e8259c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/91/5by4/2022/06/01/9109711e29054296bcb34c2fae0ed5de_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Disney+/Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Ewan McGregor, Other Stars Join Official Star Wars Account Calling Out 'Racist' Trolls DMing Moses Ingram</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>In response to Wood's tweet, actor Ismael Cruz Córdova, who has taken a lot of the heat as Elven warrior Arondir and opened up about the racist trolls he's had to endure, commented, "Much love," per <a href=#>Deadline</a>.</p><p>The one-time hobbits received additional support from other stars, including Elven High King Gil-galad actor Benjamin Walker and Owain Arthur, who portrays Dwarf prince Durin IV.
