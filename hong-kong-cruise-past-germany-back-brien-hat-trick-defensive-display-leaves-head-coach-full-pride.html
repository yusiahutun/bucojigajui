Brechin was one of eight new players Hong Kong have used over the past five days, with a prime focus of the November matches being to add some depth to the squad."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Still, Germany could find no way through, and were eventually sent away empty-handed when Hong Kong won a scrum under their own posts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The character we showed and determination to keep that line intact was really heartening,” Douglas said. “It just shows the desire they have for the jersey and to work hard for each other. So, immensely proud of that.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While the head coach said he would rather his team hadn’t been there “in the first place”, he thought holding out, and a sensational 50-22 kick from Worley soon after that spun Germany around had turned the game.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another clever kick, this time from fly half Nathan De Thierry, finally got Hong Kong on the board again, with Brien collecting on the run to grab his second.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Brechin added his first soon after, touching down following a piece of magic from Harry Laidler, whose no-look between the legs pass outfoxed the Germany defence.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At 34-10 there was little doubt as to the final outcome, and Brechin’s second and Brien’s third added a little more gloss to Hong Kong’s day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mq62Xl8ZwtM6nnmajn6O0br7UoJmyZaWjtrC6jpqpraGTobJwf5FtaWlqZ2S1sLrGZqKoppdisLPByKycZqiRqMFus8SrpJqmqWKvoq%2FKZpmroZWjeqmt02arq6GToHqlscWepayhppp6pbXSqaOasV2hsqLCxKxkoZ2RmXqku8Ccn2aepaG5brzRopue</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
