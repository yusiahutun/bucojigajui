She has been supported by a massive following over the years and is widely considered one of the best up and coming talents in the game. As she has been progressing as a rapper and artist, she has also been romantically involved with many boyfriends in this time.</p><p>Renni, who rose to fame after recording a cover of Cardi B’s hit song “Bodak Yellow”, has had many boyfriends over the years. Even as a teenager, she was romantically engaged with a guy who used to be a rapper. As a result, she gave birth to a son and a daughter while still being a teenager.</p><p>There were more rumors that she was recently in a relationship with fellow rapper Shad Moss, who is also known as Bow Mow. These rumors started circulating after Renni posted a picture of herself with Shad on her Instagram page. But there has been no any follow-up on it form neither Shad nor Renni, so we don’t know if it’s true or not.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Love_Life_Kids></span>Love Life, Kids<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Renni, who is <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">signed to Quality Control</a>, has had a tumultuous love life, to say the least.&nbsp;Just like most of the rappers, she has been involved in multiple relationships and has had many boyfriends over the years. Her first serious relationship came when she was just a teenager. She has not disclosed the name of her then-boyfriend yet.</p><p>Renni did say that he was a rapper and she used to write songs for her. Their relationship resulted in her giving birth to two children: a son and a daughter. The two broke up later and she raises her children on her own now. Renni has the <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>net worth of $300,000</a>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Current_Boyfriend_Dating_Bow_Wow></span>Current Boyfriend, Dating Bow Wow?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As far as Rucci’s current boyfriend goes, there is no news on who she is dating right now. She hasn’t been seen with anybody recently which has kept her relationship a mystery. There have been rumors, however, that she is dating rapper Bow Wow.</p><p>These rumors circulated after the two were seen together at an event. Rucci then <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">posted a picture of herself</a> with Bow on her Instagram page. But this was neither confirmed by Bow Wow nor by Rucci and it is still a mystery whether the two are actually dating or not.</p><p>For more&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>News</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Entertainment</a>&nbsp;follow&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>eCelebrityMirror</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeVo8GmvtOaoKellaPBcL7Ep6WiZaKqsKS1jJumsp6inrKvsIydmK2hnpx6o7vWZq6or18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
