Li took an hour’s leave from work to visit the ship at Ocean Terminal in Tsim Sha Tsui with her husband. She said she had paid extra attention to the layout of a laboratory on the ship as she worked for an architectural design firm.
Groups from universities, schools and companies were also among the first visitors to get a close-up view of the ship."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Drones can go to areas that are difficult for humans to reach and help with the scientific assignments.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The vessel is open free of charge to tours up to a maximum of 3,000 people between Tuesday and Friday. Pre-registration is needed for all visitors, but it appeared not everyone was aware of the requirement.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sham Yung, a 77-year-old retired doctor, left the terminal disappointed because he did not get a visit registration in advance.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong to receive icebreaker Xue Long 2 for first time in April</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We feel sorry that we don’t have the chance to visit the icebreaker,” said Yung, who wanted to see the vessel with two friends. “It is rare for a scientific research ship to come to Hong Kong so I am curious to see what is inside. I hope next time they can have a more accessible way for seniors to get tickets.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The icebreaker’s visit coincided with a two-day conference on climate change organised by the Chinese University of Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zhang Beichen, the deputy director of the Polar Research Institute of China, discussed the findings of its expeditions with a conference audience made up of scientists, researchers and policymakers from around the world and warned about the effects of climate change.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When we arrived in Antarctica this year, we faced a situation in which the sea ice was already broken,” Zhang said. “We cannot use those samples. This is the first time in our 40 years of Antarctic expeditions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The South Pole is experiencing heatwaves and melting sheet ice that in the past three decades has caused sea levels to rise by 8mm.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lawmaker Ma Fung-kwok, chairman of the organising committee for the visit, said Xue Long 2’s adventures and discoveries would spark interest in scientific research and a sense of patriotism in Hong Kong’s young people.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is crucial for them to see first-hand the wonders and challenges of exploring the unknown, fostering a deep sense of curiosity, innovation and a desire to contribute to the world’s body of knowledge,” he said in a keynote speech at the event.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This encourages our youth to partake in scientific endeavours with a sense of national pride and global responsibility. We aspire to see more young minds inspired by the Xue Long 2.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/09/536b666f-8215-4147-9d34-6cf3e9d78332_ee522af9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He emphasised the need to create a generation that valued scientific exploration and cherished the planet. Ma appealed to young people to use their talent to advance science and technology.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chinese University president Rocky Tuan Sung-chi told the gathering that dialogues between the expedition team and pupils from city schools would help motivate them to work for action on climate change.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I am confident that their interactions will motivate our students, the leaders of tomorrow, to take climate action, especially as our coastal city becomes increasingly vulnerable to rising sea levels and extreme weather events resulting from climate change,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">An exhibition on the topic and polar research is also running at the Hong Kong Science Museum until June.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wang Jinhui, the expedition’s deputy leader, earlier said he hoped that Hong Kong’s scientists would take part in the ship’s work.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Professor Ho Kin-chung, founder of visit organisers the Green Future Foundation Association and Polar Research Institute of Hong Kong, added that mainland Chinese authorities had promised to include Hongkongers in future expeditions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZoqqibmZrBunvAq6uim5yafHR%2BlHFqbXBfoq6qusuapZ1lk522r7HSnmSpp5yWv26%2BxKycmqqTnXqqr8SbqZ6Zm5q%2FbrPErapmr5Gnum7DxKWaqKWVYra1ec6pnKerXau2tLXTqKmsZZiku6h5yqiloA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
