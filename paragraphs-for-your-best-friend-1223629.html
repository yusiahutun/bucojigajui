You are my world, and I would do anything for you. You are one of the biggest reasons I found what my calling was and am following my dreams. If you ever need me for anything, I do mean anything, know that I will be there in a flash.</li><li>You have taught me so much, and I only wish you the best. I know that things might get rough, but I am always here for you. Please, do not change yourself for anyone. You are great as YOU. You will go and do great things.

To my friend who sticks closer than a sister, I love you, and here is saying I will always be here for you.</li><li>Thank you for letting our friendship be known. There is nothing I value more than my relationship with you, and it seems that everyone knows that. Thank you for sticking by my side even if we do not see each other as much as we did before, and for never forgetting about me. I appreciate that more than you could ever know.</li><li>Our friendship is more than just whether or not you come shopping with me or want to go sing karaoke with the girls. Our friendship is about you and me, ever-changing human beings who have decided we are going to love each other through this life.</li><li>Honestly, I can talk about you all day and all through the night, and even now I have a million more things to say. Be that as it may, too many words get to be good for nothing, so I will merely end it with “You are the most magnificent individual I have ever met, and I cannot envision not having you in my life."</li><li>I can honestly say I have found a true friend in you. I hope in 25 years, we will be able to look back at our past together and just be so happy we had such a close and meaningful friendship. You are truly the best friend I have ever had.

Thank you for being my partner-in-crime, drinking buddy, road-tripping companion, telepathic pal, gossip girl, personal life coach, dancing partner, and so much more.

Thank you for the times when we laughed so hard a little bit of wee popped out, danced like no one was watching, and talked until the sun shone!</p><p>9. With you by my side, the world is a better place. The sun shines a little bit brighter, my smile grows a little bit wider, and at that moment, my problems are no more.

There will be times when we will no longer see each other as often as we used to, there will be moments of ups and downs in our journey on the path of friendship, there will be a time when the stormy weather of life will seem to break the bond between us and there will be moments when we would want to call it quits between us. I want you to know that I will not give up on us, at least not without a fight, because you are the best thing that ever happened to me in life, and I will not trade you for the finest pearl in the world. I see someone who goes above and beyond to have my back. I see someone who has never given me a reason to doubt our friendship. I see someone who puts others before herself and goes out of her way to make sure they are happy. I see the kindest, most caring, and most selfless person I know. I see my support system, as a cheerleader, advisor, and confidante. I see someone who will jump through hoops to be there for me when I need a best friend. Come rain or the sunshine, you will always be my best friend forever. I love you, bestie!</p><p>54. In all the years that I have known you, you have not changed at all. You are still the same beautiful and hardworking person I met the first day. But most importantly, the one thing that has not changed is that you are still here with me. You are still by my side. You have no idea how happy that makes me feel. I may not have many friends, but it does not bother me because you are the only friend I am satisfied with, not only as my friend but also as my best friend. You are one of the most precious and significant people in my life. We may be far apart from each other, but I know our bond is stronger than the distance between us. You are such a huge blessing to me. You may not see it now, but you have made a huge impact on my life for the better. I appreciate you and all the kind gestures you have made and continue to make for me. You are one of the main reasons I believe the world can be better. Do not change anything about yourself because you are perfect just the way you are.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>55. One million memories, ten thousand inside jokes, one hundred shared secrets, one reason: best friends. Your friendship is for keeps, and I intend to keep it forever. Thank you for being my person, the one whom I can turn to when no one else is there for me. There is never a day that goes by when I am not grateful for you. I appreciate everything you do for me, even the little things such as checking up on me to make sure I am okay or buying me food when I have not eaten. All these things do not go unnoticed. Thank you for being a big part of my life. For the movie nights, countless sleepovers, laughter, and fun, you name it. Thank you for putting things on hold when I am in need. Thank you for accepting me for who I am and loving every part of me. Most of all, thank you for deciding that I would be your best friend and the person whom you put all your effort and energy into. I will continue to thank you for the rest of my life because you have been the light of my life. I hope that as we grow older we make even more memories, jokes, and shared secrets. I can already imagine us becoming old biddies who take our morning walks together as we gossip about what is going on in our lives!</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Friendship is one of the most fundamental things in our lives, and every best friend deserves the best of paragraphs.
