"People thought I'd lose my pigeonhole in my career, playing the fat funny character, and they wanted me to continue in that."</p><p>The Rebel Rising author continuously opened up about her weight loss journey in the past few years, crediting her weight loss transformation to a high protein and low sugar diet, high-intensity workouts, and hiking.</p><p>Following her transformation, Wilson said she received "positive reinforcement" from the world. However, the Pitch Perfect actress -- who previously revealed she gained some weight back -- noted that she's confident with her "curvy and solid" figure.</p><p>"I feel strongly that young women shouldn't try to obsess over looking like Victoria’s Secret models -- they should just look like themselves," Wilson said.

Lifestyle</strong></a> in May 2023. "I think, for me personally, it's always going to be dangerous in terms of the long term as well. It's super dangerous, I think we just need to focus on that calorie baseline and creating a deficit and do it that way."</p><p>"In the longterm, people get addicted to it, that's what happens as well, right? People get addicted to that," he added.</p><p>Wilson -- who welcomed her first child via surrogate in November 2022 -- previously revealed that her desire to have children sparked her weight loss journey.</p><p>During an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>PEOPLE</strong></a>, the Senior Year star opened up about the incident that sparked her 80-lb. weight loss journey.</p><p>While visiting a fertility doctor in 2019, she was told she'd have a much better chance freezing and harvesting viable eggs if she got healthier.</p><p>"He looked me up and down and said, 'You'd do much better if you were healthier,'" Wilson recalled. "I was taken aback. I thought, 'Oh God, this guy's so rude.' He was right. I was carrying around a lot of excess weight. It's almost like I didn't think of my own needs. I thought of a future child's needs that really inspired me to get healthier."</p><a id=gallery-link-32a0aee3-851b-46e9-87c7-0ba24102b708 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:32a0aee3-851b-46e9-87c7-0ba24102b708 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:c426571e-5ea4-4dde-a305-a6cda7d44aa6 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/7c/4by3/2023/12/13/7cb3f58c59794b7d86a7287f42dbee28_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21maWlfp7KjsctmrqKko6S7br7Er5yapKNiwrSxw2ams52dpbakedaeoKCgpGK5sL%2FSZqGoraKjsrp7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
