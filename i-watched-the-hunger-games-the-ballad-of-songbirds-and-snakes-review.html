The lack of chemistry between the pair left me wondering what it was about Lucy Gray that Tom was drawn to, and why Tom – a man who stood for almost everything Lucy Gray hated – would capture Lucy Gray's trust so early on.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="May December: Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore shine in dark drama" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/02f342869f3a-may-december-01-hero.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="May December: Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore shine in dark drama" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>May December: Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore shine in dark drama</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Is Saltburn worth the watch?
