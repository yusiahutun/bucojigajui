In between all the accusations and apologies, Marysol’s Mom, Mama Elsa, was seen in a flashback, reminding fans of the entertaining matriarch of the show.</strong></p><p>It’s been almost four years since Marysol Patton’s mom sadly died but, clearly, there’s a Mama Elsa-shaped hole missing on The Real Housewives of Miami. In the final part of the post series five reunion last night, the women talked more about <a href=#>Adriana’s song Fyah</a> and <a href=#>Lisa Hochstein</a> and Lenny’s divorce which dominated the series. While discussing it, a flashback scene of Mama Elsa was shown, reminding fans of the iconic figure.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mama-elsa-died-almost-four-years-ago>Mama Elsa died almost four years ago</h2><p>Coming up to four years since she died, Marysol’s mom passed away on Mother’s Day weekend in 2019. Releasing a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statement</a> to Page Six, her family confirmed she had battled a long illness.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><p>Only a year before her passing, Elsa’s husband Donald died in February 2018. The two are survived by their daughter Marysol and son Thomas Jones. They also had a grandson, Hunter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/03/GettyImages-151674051-1024x739.jpg><p>The family thanked all those who supported Elsa in her final days:</p><p>“The family is so very grateful to the many fans and friends who have continued to ask for her and offer their prayers and best wishes.</p><p>“They thank the community, her caretakers, and the many friends who have continued to check in on Elsa from all over the world. Their support has meant the world to the family.”</p><p>Marysol’s mom was lovingly known as Mama Elsa on <a href=#>RHOM</a> as she was a matriarchal figure to all the women in the show. Never afraid to share an opinion, even if it was colorful, there is no denying that she was a star of the show when it first aired on <a href=#>Bravo</a> in 2011.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=fans-remember-marysols-mom-after-rhom-reunion>Fans remember Marysol’s mom after RHOM reunion</h2><p>Fans of the show were quick to Twitter after Mama Elsa’s brief appearance in last night’s reunion.
