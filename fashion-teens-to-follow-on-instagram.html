Chalk it up to the democracy of the Internet or the rise of the Insta generation, but it seems now more than ever that being a cool teen is trending hard—at least according to our <a href=# id=auto-tag_instagram data-tag=instagram>Instagram</a> feeds. These kids might be half our age, but that doesn’t stop them from having thousands (or in some cases, millions) more followers than us. Here, the top 19 teens taking over fashion, one Instagram at a time.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/gigi-hadid-bradley-cooper-zayn-malik.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/maybelline-instant-age-rewind-concealer.png><p><strong>Luka Sabbat:</strong> Luka Sabbat might be the coolest kid you don’t know (yet!). Not only is he best friends with designer&nbsp;<strong>Virgil Abloh</strong>, but he’s worked with <strong>Kanye West</strong>, modeling for both of his Yeezy presentations. Sabbat has modeled for every streetwear brand from Been Trill to Stussy, and he also did a stint with Hood By Air. If you want to catch Sabbat IRL, outside of his Instagram feed, you can find him running with the impossibly cool kids of the downtown set, probably with his signature lit cigarette (rumor has it that he started smoking at age 12).</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/9TvDGhxj5r/</a></p><p><strong>Eileen Kelly:</strong> Technically,&nbsp;Eileen Kelly is not a teen at the ripe age of 20. But baby-faced Kelly has&nbsp;best friends like <strong>Taylor Hill</strong> and Luka Sabbat, and her precocious Instagram account (with sultry selfies) is&nbsp;Lolita clickbait at its best.</p><p><strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_jaden-smith data-tag=jaden-smith>Jaden Smith</a>:</strong> Jaden Smith is not your typical celeb kid. Somewhere between his film debut in The Pursuit of Happyness and now, he’s amassed a cult following among the prepubescent hypebeast (read: fuccbois). His quirks and claims of genius peg him to be the Kanye West of the Insta generation.</p><p><b>Pia Mia</b><strong>:</strong> Princess Pia Mia is a singer from Guam who’s yet to score a radio hit&nbsp;but who&nbsp;has an Instagram following of&nbsp;3 million. A quick peek at her feed&nbsp;shows the singer living her life (and often hanging out with bestie&nbsp;<strong>Kylie Jenner</strong>).</p><p><strong>Betts Lucid:</strong> Betts is one half of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Lucid Twins,&nbsp;the brains behind Lucid Footwear and Clothing (think preppy streetwear at its minimalist best). He’s definitely a teen on the rise, so you’ll want to follow his feed (and his twin brother’s) for a peek into downtown life.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/9tpRCruRZl/</a></p><p><strong>Chet Lucid:</strong> The other Lucid twin, Chet, has a feed filled with snaps of his life as a designer and adolescent multihyphenate.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/98qbslBaLR/</a></p><p><strong>Lily-Rose Depp:</strong> When your mother is <strong>Vanessa Paradis,</strong> and your father is <strong>Johnny Depp</strong>, you’re bound to win the genetic jackpot. Lily-Rose Depp is only sweet 16, but she’s already a front-row favorite thanks to her French-girl cool. Look for her gamine figure at the Chanel show or on her Instagram where she has a hot one million followers.</p><p><strong>Lucky Blue Smith:</strong> Without a doubt, this is the year of Lucky Blue Smith. With platinum blonde hair, piercing blue eyes, and a modest 1.5 million Instagram followers, Lucky Blue Smith has been a ubiquitous face&nbsp;in editorials, campaigns, and on the runway. Our favorite moment to date? When Lucky channeled <strong>Christopher Walken&nbsp;</strong>for the first issue of CR Fashion Book Men.</p><p><strong>Pyper America Smith:</strong> Pyper America not only shares brother Lucky Blue Smith’s platinum hair and otherworldly good looks but also his crazy social following. Fun fact: She also makes her own videos at Pyper TV, which run the gamut from flirtatious to hilarious.</p><p><strong>Harry Brant:</strong> Harry Brant is the socialite spawn of supermodel <strong>Stephanie Seymour</strong> and art mogul <strong>Peter Brant</strong>, which, as he self-proclaims, gives him an appreciation of the “aesthetic.” You can catch Harry partying with <strong>Naomi Campbell</strong>, <strong>Andreja Pejic</strong>, and <strong>Hanne Gaby Odiele</strong>—that is, when he’s not busy working on his upcoming MAC collaboration with brother <strong>Peter Brant Jr.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/95I7W0m_Yh/</a></p><p><strong>Tavi Gevinson:</strong> Tavi Gevinson is probably the industry’s most seasoned teenager. She rose to fame as a fashion blogger at the age of 12 and now runs her own magazine, Rookie Mag, while also working as a writer and actress.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/-CGCLskNuo/</a></p><p><strong>Bella Hadid:</strong> Bella Hadid jumped to fame as the little sister of industry favorite&nbsp;<strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_gigi-hadid data-tag=gigi-hadid>Gigi Hadid</a></strong>, but the 18-year-old is making a name for herself as a model. With pals like <strong>Kendall Jenner</strong> and <strong>Hailey Baldwin</strong>, plus boyfriend Abel Tesfaye (you might know him as <strong>The Weeknd</strong>), we’re sure that we’ll continue to see lots more of Bella in the future.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/9C4utyJpfg/</a></p><p><strong>Kaia Gerber:</strong> Talk about good genes! Kaia Gerber might be only 14, but she’s already the gorgeous spitting image of her mother, <strong>Cindy Crawford</strong>. So far, she’s&nbsp;nabbed editorials in Vogue Italia and CR Fashion Book.&nbsp;We’d say&nbsp;her career is already off to an illustrious&nbsp;start.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/9ysJCjFDO3/</a></p><p><strong>Hailey Baldwin:</strong> Hailey Baldwin (yes, of those&nbsp;Baldwins!)&nbsp;only recently arrived on the modeling scene, but her signature pout and casual friendships with <strong>Justin Bieber</strong> and <strong>Gigi Hadid</strong>&nbsp;have catapulted the 18-year-old to Internet fame and over 2 million Instagram followers.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/9w3XB8PNjx/</a></p><p><strong>Willow Smith:</strong> Like her brother Jaden, Willow Smith is a cultural wonder—she was the youngest artist ever signed to Jay Z’s Roc Nation, if that tells you anything. Don’t come to Willow’s feed for gratuitous selfies; you can, however, find plenty of art and concepts on her ‘gram.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/93rWplm1Yv/</a></p><p><strong>Amandla Stenberg:</strong> Amandla Stenberg jumped into the media spotlight when she portrayed Rue in the Hunger Games series. However, she proved that she was more than just a pretty face and a talented actress when she called out Kylie Jenner’s cultural appropriation of cornrows. Sternberg uses her nearly 500,000 followers to fight for social justice, a refreshing use of social media in the Insta-generation.</p><p><strong>Taylor Hill:</strong> This doe-eyed model has walked almost every major runway in the last few seasons, but her fans probably know her best for being the youngest Victoria’s Secret model ever. Her wide-eyed, easy beauty translates well into editorial work, but it’s probably Hill’s down-to-earth Instagram posts that keep people coming back to her feed for more.</p><p><strong>Alli Simpson:</strong> The little sister of Gigi Hadid’s ex-boyfriend&nbsp;<strong>Cody Simpson</strong>, Aussie Alli Simpson has a huge following from the adolescent set. The feed is mostly selfies of the bubbly blonde, but given her nearly 2 million followers, she’s definitely one to watch.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/-AW0penGvS/</a></p><p><strong>Kylie Jenner:</strong> No teen has risen to as much fame (or notoriety) as astronomically as Kylie Jenner. At only 18, she’s a media mogul who’s spent most of her life being on reality television. Whether fending off questions about lip injections,<strong> Tyga</strong>, or her latest outfit, you can be sure that Kylie will probably be posting a Snapchat or a selfie about it to her 42 million followers&nbsp;later.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ynrdKhoKimXaOyuL%2BObXBwbmNufKet0qGgqKZdqbKmutJmq6hllqS5rbvWZqanZZmjwLWtxquYpmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
