Well, temporarily, at least.</p><p>However, now it looks like this is becoming a more widespread issue. Multiple users on Reddit have reported an X over the camera icon on the infotainment display. When they try to use Sentry Mode or access the cams, they're greeted with an error message saying, "Dashcam unavailable -- Check USB Drive."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/0f6c8389.jpg> <a href=#>DriveTesla</a> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many owners suspected the USB drive had a problem, but according to Tesla, this is actually a software issue that should get resolved in an upcoming software update. One user reached out to Tesla's support team, and this is part of the response he received.</p><p>"The flash drive is unmounting, causing the dash camera to go to a paused state, which triggers sentry to stop recording as soon as it starts."</p><p>While some reports online believe this problem started with the recent&nbsp;2022.12.3.2 software update from Tesla, we're seeing other owners mentioning it's not a new situation. Users have dealt with this off and on for months, but now that Tesla is aware of it, a fix should be coming soon.</p><p>Tesla said this is nothing more than a firmware issue and that once the fix is available, it'll be sent out as a software update. However, Tesla gave no other details or a potential release date for the OTA release. So, if you're experiencing problems with your Tesla dash cams or Sentry Mode, open the glove box, unplug and plug back in your USB drive, or wait for the update.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>via <a href=#>DriveTeslaCanada</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhoanBkbIVwwMSso5plla29ra3Ip6pmr5iuerq71KtknZmjnXqkrcxmmKecXaiyr8DRsmSmp5SaeqK%2BxGaZq6ebmrtw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
