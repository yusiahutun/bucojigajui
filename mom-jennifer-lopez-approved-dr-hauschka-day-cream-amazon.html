And for many reasons, I hope that to be true in my case. My mom's the hardest worker I know, she somehow holds a golden nugget of wisdom for everything, and she always manages to maintain a positive attitude even through the most stressful of situations.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">People always say we look alike — we've even been mistaken for sisters before. That instance could probably be chalked up to simple flattery, but hey, maybe it wasn't: My mom is 61, but she doesn't look a day over 45. She has seemingly zero wrinkles and the most glowing, smoothest, softest skin ever, a trait I hope to emulate when I'm her age. Fingers crossed the adage holds water.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Good genes certainly play a factor in her wrinkle-free complexion, but she's also used one particular cream for decades, and she swears it has kept her skin bouncy, glowy, and ageless. She's almost certainly one of <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Dr. Hauschka's Revitalizing Day Cream</a>'s most steadfast fans (sponsor her, <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Dr. Hauschka</a>!), and she's turned me, my sister, and countless friends on to the German skincare brand.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>$75; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">This cream does the job</a>. It hydrates, smooths, and plumps thanks to impressive ingredients like nurturing anthyllis, witch hazel, and carrot for balancing moisture and apricot kernel, sweet almond, and wheat germ oils for protection, nourishment, and revitalization.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's basically <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">magic in a bottle</a>, a statement I'm sure my mom would agree with. She's proof of this cream's powers, after all: She regularly gets asked what foundation she uses because her skin looks so poreless and perfect. "None," she says. She doesn't wear (let alone need) any face makeup because her skin already looks flawless and airbrushed on its own. It's only feasible to credit that to the one moisturizer she's used for decades, right? She won't use anything else.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">My family is partial to German products (we're originally from Germany), but there's no bias here. With this cream, there's simply no denying its effectiveness. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jennifer Lopez is a fan of the skincare brand</a>, too, and she literally hasn't aged in years. <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">J.Lo swears by the Rose Day Cream</a>, which my mom also has in her rotation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hundreds of Amazon shoppers are also <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">singing this day cream's praises</a>, and much like my mom, the majority say they won't use anything else on their face.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I started using Dr. Hauschka products in my mid-30's. I am now 70, and I continue to use the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Dr. Hauschka Day Cream</a> religiously. My skin looks fantastic, if I do say so myself," wrote one shopper. "I cannot overstate the value of this product. One of the few moisturizers on the market that is absolutely worth the price. Thank you Dr. Hauschka. This is just about the only product I can use that does not cause my skin to break out."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Worth noting: My mom is very selective with what she uses on her skin, so the fact that she's put her trust in this particular Dr. Hauschka cream for decades speaks volumes to its formula. The brand is a pioneer in the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>clean beauty world</a>, and its skincare products contain zero mineral oils, silicones, PEGs, or synthetic preservatives. Everything, from its creams to its face oils, is made from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">100 percent natural raw ingredients</a> that come from a mix of biodynamic herb gardens, certified-sustainable German farms, and fair-trade global partnerships.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's what I know for sure: When I'm 61, I want to have skin like my mom's, and that's reason enough for me to stock up on <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">every assortment of Dr. Hauschka's creams</a>. Good thing they're on Amazon and can get delivered in just a few days. Until then, I'll be secretly stealing my mom's.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>$45; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>$45; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZL2zu8Oumq2rXam8sLjSaKSopV2fsq%2B6yJ%2Bcq2WcpL2mxoyap6mqn6uypXnDq2ShmaWosKm3wGabmrFdmL%2BmrcxmmKaZqqS7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
