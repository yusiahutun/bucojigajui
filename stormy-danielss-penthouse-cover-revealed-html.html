'And a guy walked up to me and said to me, "Leave Trump alone.

I didn't want him to think I was a bad mom and I put our daughter in danger.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>McCain asked why Daniels had never detailed the threat until the 60 Minutes interview, as the porn star had spoken off-the-record to news outlets, including ABC News, about her encounter with Trump, then running for president, in the weeks before the election.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The adult film actress replied that she didn't want to be asked the question McCain had just asked – why not call the cops? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I did tell quite a few people actually from back then,' Daniels then volunteered. 'I told family members and two friends and people that I worked with.' &nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>At that point Avenatti jumped in to say that there was no way his client could 'fabricate' the man's face.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'This is a very detailed sketch,' he said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He explained how the sketch had been made by a woman named Lois Gibson who often works with the FBI.&nbsp;'She found Stormy to be very credible,' Avenatti added.&nbsp;</p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/17/14/4B3FA9A600000578-0-image-m-10_1523972883924.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Comey insists he didn't mock the size of Trump's hands in...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/17/00/4B3A557800000578-0-image-m-7_1523920494843.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Michael Cohen knows he could go to prison friend reveals as...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/16/23/4B3A8D5500000578-0-image-a-44_1523917588393.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Trump continues to struggle in search of new attorney to...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/16/20/4B39800900000578-0-image-a-29_1523907438221.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Comey deepens mystery of 'classified information' that...</span></a></li></ul><h2>Share this article</h2><span class=wai>Share</span> <span>825</span> shares<p class=mol-para-with-font>Co-host Joy Behar pointed out that the man 'looks like an actor, sort of.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'That's what stood out to me because I thought, honestly, that he was, you know, sort of handsome,' Daniels said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Avenatti had planned to release the drawing publicly last week, but the raid of Trump attorney Michael Cohen's office and hotel room delayed the unveiling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Due to the FBI raids of Mr. Cohen’s office/home and a subsequent request we received this morning to delay the release of the forensic sketch of the thug that threatened Ms. Clifford to "leave Trump alone", we will not be releasing the sketch or reward details today. Timing TBD,' Avenatti tweeted last week after the Monday morning raid.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Cohen was responsible for giving Daniels $130,000 in hush money in October 2016 in exchange for her signing a non-disclosure agreement that barred her from talking about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Avenatti has made a number of legal maneuvers to prevent Daniels from having to pay damages for violating the NDA, which the lawyer had argued is invalid since Trump never signed on as a party.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Cohen, for his part, has said he paid Daniels personally, and Trump has backed that account up.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Let me just say, I work in the adult business and I'm a better actress than he is,' Daniels replied to a clip The View played showing Trump denying he knew about the hush money payment. &nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The longtime Trump fixer was in federal court Monday trying to prevent prosecutors from examining the content seized from the FBI's raid on Cohen's properties a week before.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Daniels and Avenatti showed up at the hearing and then spoke to press waiting outside.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'For years Mr. Cohen has acted like he is above the law, he has considered himself and openly referred to himself as Mr. Trump's fixer. He has played by a different set of rules , or should we say, no rules at all,' Daniels told the crowd. 'He has never thought that the little man, or especially women, even more – women like me – mattered.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'That ends now,' the porn star said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'My attorney and me are committed to making sure that everyone finds out the truth and the facts of what happens, and I give my word that we will not rest until that happens,' Daniels said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Pointing to Daniels' appearance outside the courtroom today, McCain said she thought it looked like a publicity stunt, mentioning how Daniels seemed to be benefiting financially from the headlines, as she's embarked on a 'Make America Horny Again' strip club tour.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Can I say, first of all, I did not name the tour,' she said, calling the name 'awful' and explaining how a strip club owner in the Carolinas dubbed her appearance there after the Trump campaign slogan.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I'm making more money, but I'm spending so much more. My daughter, we have to hire a tutor now. And I have like bodyguards. You don't even want to know their food bill, because I have to feed them three times a day, and they are big,' Daniels said to laughs. 'Yes, I am dancing more, yes, I am making more money, but I am spending more money.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Daniels said that her ambition was not to move out of the adult film industry using the money from her scandal, but instead had wanted to keep growing as a director.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I had a passion project of mine in the works for the last several years to direct a horror movie and those people that were my investors completely abandoned me,' Daniels said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Without a beat, Behar asked, 'Will Trump be in the movie?'&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>McCain also asked what the end game was for the porn star.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'On a selfish note, it is my chance to defend myself and make people realize how and why this happens, so I can tell my side,' Daniels replied. 'That is my selfish reason, not going to lie about that part.' &nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Avenatti chimed in too saying, 'We want the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'You should not be afraid or bullied,' Daniels added. &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWKCd36Vcm1wZ4OpvLO52GZ7mqaZmrm0v4yJnKesmKTCtLGMnKavnaJiv6bCxJqjnpxencGuuA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
