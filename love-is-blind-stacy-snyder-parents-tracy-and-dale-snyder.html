Read all about her family here in this article. The article covers it all. So, keep scrolling down to read all about her parents!</p><h3><strong>Love Is Blind: Who Are Stacy Snyder Parents?</strong></h3><p>Stacy Snyder the daughter of Dale and Tracy Snyder. September 1988 saw the birth of Stacy Snyder. She turned 35 years old in September 2023.</p><p>In 2010, Stacy Snyder started her employment at Cadillac Ranch as a server. In 2011, she worked at Abercrombie & Fitch as an assistant manager. She worked there from January to May, during which time she oversaw a group of 20 associates, carried out daily operations while putting a special emphasis on loss prevention, gave employees assignments to help them meet daily shop goals, and more.</p><p>Stacy was hired by Varsity Brands as a Midwest sales advisor in June 2023. From 2011 to 2013, she was employed there. Each year, she helped with the development and execution of 12 to 15 events. Additionally, she organized and trained all of the event employees, put up and took down all of the stations, and coordinated and oversaw the judging panel.</p><p>Stacy has been employed by Petromar since 2014 as the Head Of Operations as of 2023. The Closet Audit was also started by her. Stacy also attended the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and Arizona State University.</p><p>Love Is Blind premiered in 2023 and castaway for season 5.</p><p>Despite having just been single for a little over a year, Stacy is prepared to “push herself to open up and be vulnerable” in order to meet her ideal match. She’s looking for a “family-oriented, outgoing, and driven” person in the pods. Stacy, a former college athlete who now teaches pilates in her leisure time, needs someone who can keep up with her in the gym.</p><p>Stacy is extremely repulsed by “one-uppers” who “don’t have an awareness of other people.” And if Stacy does find the one, he will need to get along with her family because holiday gaming gatherings are big events and “super competitive.”</p><p>In order to find a partner, a group of single people turned to Love Is Blind. This time, the pods are located right in the middle of Texas. The social experiment that has been separating group chats since 2020 returns for Season 5 on September 22, and a new cast set off on a tense path of emotional development and self-discovery. As they test the boundaries and potential of an emotional connection, co-hosts Nick and Vanessa Lachey will once again lead a new group of eligible men and women into the pods and out of the dating abyss.</p><p>The trip has only just begun for the engaged couples who make it out of the pods and through the drama — and trust us, this season delivers like no other. They’ll have to find out if their relationship is built to last once they’ve adjusted to life after the honeymoon period. It won’t be long before the couples are standing at the altar and can respond to the only other question that matters.</p><h3><strong>Meet Dale Snyder, Stacy Snyder Father</strong></h3><p>Dale Snyder is Love Is Blind Stacy Synder’s father. The father and daughter are very close to each other and enjoy spending time together. Mostly, they share the love of watching baseball.</p><p>“Happy Father’s Day to the best dad a girl could ask for .. So grateful to get to spend a day just with you to celebrate all of the love you deserve and sacrifice you have made ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️,” Stacy’s Father’s Day post on her IG read.</p><p>In another post from 2014, she gushed, “My favorite guy on earth !!

He continues to say what Stacy expects, and it’s unclear if this is a relationship deal breaker.</p><p>“It doesn’t mean that he’s gotta make a million dollars, but it means that she doesn’t wanna go Dutch, you know on a meal,” Dale says. “She thinks she’s worth being taken care of in that manner.”</p><p>The Snyder women stayed inside the home throughout the program, but Dale and Izzy had a cordial conversation while sitting down outside, and Izzy was able to hold his own when Stacy’s father spoke. “The whole&nbsp;Love is Blind thing I get that,” Dale says. “But love also needs to eat. Love needs to have a roof. Sometimes love wants to fly first-class.”</p><p>He inquires as to Izzy’s plans for the next five to ten years, and Izzy replies that while he has some worries about his new job opportunity, financially, “the sky’s the limit.”</p><p>“I’m hopeful. I’m very optimistic. I think you’ve got a very good head on your shoulders,” says Dale. “I can see how the&nbsp;experiment&nbsp;has some upside to it… It’s like you guys are saying, ‘Well what are you waiting for?'”</p><h3><strong>Meet Tracy Snyder, Stacy Snyder Mother</strong></h3><p><img alt=Love-Is-Blind-Stacy-Snyder-Mother-Tracy-Snyder width=300 height=282 data-sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Love-Is-Blind-Stacy-Snyder-Mother-Tracy-Snyder-300x282.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Stacy Snyder’s mother is named Tracy Snyder (Dugan).
