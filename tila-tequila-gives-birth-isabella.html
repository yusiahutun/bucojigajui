"I know for a fact that I am really going to miss being pregnant because to be honest, I have really, really enjoyed my pregnancy so far! I love being able to feel my baby move inside of me, I know when she's happy, I know she hears me when I talk to her. I just feel this incredible bond with my daughter and I feel like she is so safe in there and protected from all harm! Maybe that's why she doesn't wanna come out?"</p><p>Tila has not revealed who the father of her child is and says she will be "raising her alone."</p><p>"My daughter will grow up to be a leader and stand up for all of the people who cannot stand up for themselves. My daughter will be beautiful just like her mama, but at the same time I will raise her to be a humble and loving person who will respect herself and others," she said in <a href=#><strong>an earlier blog post</strong></a>. "I know I'm going to be a fantastic Mother to my little Warrior Princess Baby Girl because she will see how much crap that her mommy has been through in life."</p><p>What do you think of the name Isabella Monroe?
