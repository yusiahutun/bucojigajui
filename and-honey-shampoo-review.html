The results? My damaged hair felt refreshed and hydrated after just one wash.&nbsp;After years of compromising the health of my hair with bleach, the promise of shiny soft hair seemed years away. I was shocked the <a href=#>TikTok-viral </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>shampoo</a> gave me results so soon.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IMG_3093.jpg><p>I was skeptical before using &Honey’s Deep Moist Shampoo. Moisturizing shampoos I’ve used in the past haven’t always answered my hair concerns, but instead left my hair greasy and heavy. Not to mention, living in New York City’s humid climate means I also have oily hair to worry about. My ideal shampoo would clean my oily scalp and rehydrate my brittle ends—a combination that’s hard to find.</p><p>Thankfully, the &Honey Deep Moist Shampoo succeeded at both. Right off the bat, it smelled amazing and lathered beautifully, which made me feel like I was washing away all of the oil my scalp was building up. I worked the shampoo throughout my hair, in order to moisturize my dry ends. After conditioning and letting my hair air dry, I immediately noticed a difference. My hair was soft to the touch and looked shiny in the light, without feeling overly greasy or heavy. (Honestly, I was surprised my hair could look so healthy.) Not to mention, the sweet scent lingered and left me feeling like I’d just come home from an expensive salon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IMG_3065_e46407-rotated.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IMG_3083_1f4d02.jpg><p>While &Honey’s Deep Moist Shampoo is my go-to, the brand has tons of other <a rel=nofollow href=#>TikTok-viral </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>products</a> that are great for different hair types. <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/pmc_0aaa4_stylecaster?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D87443X1593552%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3D--%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Ffreshbeautyco.com.au%252Fproducts%252F295303-honey-melty-moist-repair-shampoo%253Fvariant%253D42685710893256&p=https%3A%2F%2Fstylecaster.com%2Flists%2Fand-honey-shampoo-review%2F&ref=pmcTrackonomicsReferrer&event_type=click">&Honey’s Melty range</a> is for frizzy hair and boosts your hair’s glow.
