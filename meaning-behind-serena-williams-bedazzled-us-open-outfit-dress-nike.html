"Serena expects nothing less than to push the boundaries, and to quote her, 'Every time I see a design from Nike, I expect it to be better than the last.' This expectation not only gives us permission for the ultimate creative freedom, but she has made me a better designer."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The dress Williams wore, which features a crystal-encrusted bodice with a V-shaped cut where it meets the six-layer skirt, was inspired by figure skating apparel. The six layers are a reference to Williams's six Flushing titles. The jewels on the bodice, meanwhile, are meant to represent the night sky at the US Open.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"For the first time, Serena prepared a brief for me, as well as sketches," Ellis says. "She loves the grace, strength, and sheer skill of ice dancers, and was really inspired by the embellishments their costumes are known for. So we worked into several different designs, combining her ideas; experimenting and ideating. I knew this had to be perfect. Once we had her dress dialed, we, of course, wanted to build in some surprises for the Queen, which came in the form of the crystal-emblazoned train and bedazzled jacket."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ellis says the look entirely embodies Williams, as it mirrors her bravery, uniqueness, and bold beauty—and, yes, it is also very extra, in the best way.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>"</strong>Serena is the greatest. She is known for redefining the traditionally more stuffy, boring world of tennis, both in terms of what is possible and what defines traditional tennis apparel. She wanted this dress for the US Open to be unforgettable, but she wanted a different kind of disruption," Ellis adds. "Her key word was iconic. No matter what Serena played in last night, she would have made it iconic. The moment would have made it historic."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As Williams walked onto the court last night, witnesses stood in the stands giving her a standing ovation. When it was time to play, she removed her jacket and train, then took out her tennis racket.</p><img alt="new york, usa, august 29 serena williams of the united states warming up before her match against danka kovinic of montenegro on arthur ash stadium in the womens singles round one match during the us open tennis championship 2022 at the usta national tennis centre on august 29th 2022 in flushing, queens, new york city photo by tim claytoncorbis via getty images" title="US Open Tennis Championship 2022" width=1024 height=683 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1661876585.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Tim Clayton - Corbis</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To wrap up the match, the US Open shared a tribute to Williams in the form of a video with speeches from Oprah Winfrey and tennis champion Billie Jean King, as well as a "We ❤️ Serena " poster stunt put on by fans in the stands.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Husband, Alexis Ohanian, and daughter Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., joined in the applause from the stands—the four-year-old looking adorable in a mini version of her mother's sparkling tennis dress and tiny white beads finishing her braids.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ellis says, "There are no words that can summarize the pressure and responsibility that come with designing a piece of history, for the Greatest of all Time.
