The couple shares three children: Cambron, Mia,&nbsp;and Vivian, and they often use their social media to show the&nbsp;love they have for their&nbsp;family.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in 2014, Marty&nbsp;uploaded a family photo in his Instagram account and declared that his family is his life in the caption.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Marty also takes the liberty to wish his lovely wife a happy anniversary every year. He announced the news of their 16 years of&nbsp;togetherness through his Instagram&nbsp;account and also hinted that he has a cheerful&nbsp;family in the caption that read,</p><p>16 years. Hard to harness where they've all gone.&nbsp;Dreams.&nbsp;Three beautiful children and days full of laughter are more than I deserve. â¤ï¸</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Moreover, the loving husband, Marty even wished his wife a happy 40th birthday on 7 February 2017 by posting a beautiful vintage photo of the couple and wrote a beautiful message to his wife.

Half our lives. Together. We've experienced euphoria and great sorrow, love and hurt, crushing losses and humbling wins. We have three beautiful kids who even like us every now and then. Our lives' experience has unearthed riches beyond treasures and our mutual respect is esteemed and cultivated by the steely plow of time. No one I've ever met is more selfless. I love this photo. It is joy. And the heart-shaped, mirrored Wal-Mart frame I put it in in 1999 is timeless. Happy 40th, beautiful.</p><p>The time that usually wears out relationships seems to be fortifying the bond this couple shares. Even after years of being together, Marty and Lainie carry a great deal of&nbsp;love and affection for each other.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Earlier, on 7 December 2017, Marty uploaded a&nbsp;delectable picture where he can be seen kissing Lainie on her cheeks while Lainie is all in smiles.
