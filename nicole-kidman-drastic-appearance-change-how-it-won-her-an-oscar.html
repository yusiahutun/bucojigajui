In 2002, the now 56-year-old star received her first shot at acclaim when she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for Moulin Rouge, and just the following year, won for The Hours.
However, while much of the discourse surrounding her nomination and eventual win centered on her talent, a lot of it zeroed in on one major transformation – the nose."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Oscar-winning costume designer Ann told the Times that she recalled Harvey snapping: "I paid a million dollars for that girl, and no one knows who she is."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8088f6a698b5-virginia-woolf.jpg><p id=eWfLL9qxdVU4 data-wc=51>When the film was first released, critics and audiences were divided by the prosthetic choice as well. In a review for <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TIME</a>, Richard Schickel wrote of the movie: "Watching The Hours, one finds oneself focusing excessively on the unfortunate prosthetic nose Kidman effects in order to look more like the novelist."</p><p id=eKgGfUaVoUHJ data-wc=28>Nicole, for her part, was visibly uncomfortable with discussing the topic in the press, once telling <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a>&nbsp;</strong>during a promotional interview: "I hate talking about the nose."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fd07cac6e659-nicole-kidman-the-hours-co-stars.jpg><p id=ekO5VsQrnAp3 data-wc=38>However, many saw the appearance change as a dual internal and external transformation that solidified Nicole's place as a top-tier actor, one who was already on the rise thanks to Moulin Rouge and The Others, also from 2001.</p><p id=e7F4HBeWLHFz data-wc=58>A.O. Scott wrote for <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The New York Times</a> at the time: "Ms. Kidman's physical transformation into Virginia Woolf seemed so impressive – and was so extravagantly praised – in part because it seemed so unlikely, because she had not struck anyone, until then, as the kind of actress who could disappear so completely on screen."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a3934261110c-nicole-kidman-harvey-weinstein.jpg><p id=elRV6Aky0Qnd data-wc=45>The narrative was there for Nicole to take home the big prize come March 23, 2003 at the 75th Academy Awards, up against <a class=hm-link href=#>Salma Hayek</a> in Frida, <a class=hm-link href=#>Renée Zellweger</a> in Chicago, Diane Lane in Unfaithful, and The Hours co-star <a class=hm-link href=#>Julianne Moore</a> in Far from Heaven.</p><p id=endXCw_PY2qC data-wc=35>While Salma and Renée were also (in retrospect, unfortunately) part of the Miramax machine that Oscar season, all attention was on Nicole, particularly on the buzz about whether her controversial appearance change would bear fruit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cd5add0158ea-nicole-kidman-2003-oscars.jpg><p id=eT5ArrVVF3eD data-wc=39>Sure enough, when Denzel Washington read out the results, he joked: "By a nose, Nicole Kidman!" Since then, Nicole has been nominated at the Oscars three more times, all without "the nose."
