Unlike here in the UK, she claims it’s "possible" to be naked "365 days a year" in the "Hawaii of Europe".</p><p>Karie Jane, from the UK, opened BHH Nudist Resort in Costa Calma, <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Fuerteventura</a>, after converting her holiday home which she originally owned with her ex-husband. She says that naturism is "liberating" but not sexual "on any level" – and can be enjoyed all winter in the Canary Islands.</p><p>The island is just four hours away by air and can be reached for as little as <a href=# rel=nofollow>£25 for a return flight</a>.

And its only a four hour flight away.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31394250.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_KJ_bar.jpg><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=31390982><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index1|Image aria-label="Lesser-known Canary Island is hot all year-round and the beaches are never crowded" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=31390982><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31391097.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_Pretty-lesser-known-canary-island-thats-hot-all-year-round-with-flights-only-£120.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31391097.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Pretty-lesser-known-canary-island-thats-hot-all-year-round-with-flights-only-£120.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index1|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=31390982>Lesser-known Canary Island is hot all year-round and the beaches are never crowded</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=31373981><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index2|Image aria-label="'I've travelled to every country in the world twice – there's many highlights'" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=31373981><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31373079.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/2_JS315997597_Banner-.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index2|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=31373981>'I've travelled to every country in the world twice – there's many highlights'</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><p>"It is summer all year long and possible to practice naturism 356 days a year, especially since we have the most naturist beaches in the whole of Canary Islands put together. Many of which are remote and offer secluded areas for naturists to enjoy without feeling crowded."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31373079.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/2_JS315997597_Banner-.jpg><p>Karie has previously noted that the beaches in the area are accommodating of naked swimmers and sunbathers and her guests back up the claim. <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Gill and Keith</a>, from the UK, said: "There are fantastic breaches – they go for miles and there’s hardly anybody there. Anyone who is there doesn’t bat an eyelid!"</p><p>While naked yogi, Matt, who ran his <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>retreat at Karie’s resort</a> said: "One night we took dinner down to the beach, had a couple of bottles of wine to share and we did a short yoga practice on the beach before dinner. But, sand is a very unstable surface and we were falling over all covered in sand having a great laugh. We were completely naked and we ran into the sea and had a good swim before the meal."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>Karie commented: "Spain, including the Canary Islands like Fuerteventura, has a relatively liberal approach to naturism, and there are no specific laws against public nudity in designated areas. Overall, Fuerteventura offers a combination of favorable weather, beautiful naturist-friendly locations, and a welcoming atmosphere, making it an appealing choice for naturists seeking winter sun."</p><p>Plus she noted that BHH Nudist Resort isn’t the only holiday hotspot on the island. Karie said: "There are several naturist-friendly resorts and accommodations on the island, ensuring that visitors have options for a comfortable and accepting environment. As well as my naturist resort, with four independent apartments in Costa Calma, south of the Island, some of the large hotels do have terraces for nude sunbathing set aside."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31394333.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Sunset_wind_farm.jpg><p>Karie’s resort boasts the Naturist Apartment, Au Natural Apartment, Buff Apartment and Bare Apartment. All of which you can strip off inside. But, there’s also a swimming pool, patio and outdoor dining area where you can enjoy your day without any clothes on – and the whole resort is surrounded by a tall white wall that ensures nobody walking by catches an eyeful!</p><p>Rooms at the hotel range from £70 a night to £140 a night depending on which apartment you book and how many people stay.
