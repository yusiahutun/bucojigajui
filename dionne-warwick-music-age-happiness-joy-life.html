I am very very excited about this."</p><p id=eoSdTUb5aGHg data-wc=81>In speaking to Dionne, one can’t help but admire her confidence. &nbsp;"I like me, I am who I am and will always be. I know my skin very well. I was brought up that way, we were brought up to be who we are, and taught all the protocols, be kind, be generous, be honest, prayerful–all those things we were taught from the cradle and I carry that with me… I don't look for joy, joy is a part of me."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaJ%2BemZyptW6tzZ1kn6Gko7K0v45uZ2tsZmx8pbXOp6WeZaeWv7i1wqRkpq2jnrBurcaeZKGZoKW2r7HSrGSjp6liuaqyxGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
