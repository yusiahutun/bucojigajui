With nature as an inspiration and a clean, unfussy aesthetic, not to mention an approachable price point, we think this designer has the fashion game figured out.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>HB: How would you describe the aesthetic of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.emersonfry.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Emerson Fry" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Emerson Fry</a>?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Emerson Fry</strong>: Our line is focused on modern, clean, versatile pieces.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Harper's Bazaar:What is it like to work out of NH? Does your locale inspire you?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>EF: </strong>I find inspiration wherever we are at the time, because you're really carrying around so many imprints from life/the world in your head and that's where it comes from. Initially, NH presented some challenges most of which are obvious, i e. being remote from suppliers, vendors, manufactures, etc. and we considered relocating our office several times. But as we established our team and resolved the above, no problem! I see no difference than being anywhere else in the world. Ultimately, having our design studio outside the industry is proving to be quite valuable.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>HB: Where do you mine inspiration mainly?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>EF: </strong>Thinking about the future. It took a decade, but we are finally moving away from the past and entering the new century and there are some very exciting things happening. The future we see will be about the individual and consciousness.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>HB: Tell me about this spring collection, what did you have in mind?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>EF: </strong>To create easy, versatile pieces that are long-wearing and can be worn different ways. Women have such diverse responsibilities, such full, active lives so their wardrobe has to compliment that. For that transitional season (i.e. cold spring) we incorporated some light coats because we found that a lot of our customers are looking for trans-seasonal pieces where you need a little topper but not a heavy coat. So we are offering some nice pieces for that in our first spring collection.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>HB: Why is it important to you to keep the price point approachable?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>EF: </strong>Because that's what's realistic and it's important to us. We are focused on offering women high quality pieces that are attainable, wearable and worth the investment. Pieces she'll keep for the long run. We produce with the same luxury producers and with same high-end fabrics. We just made the conscious choice to keep our price points accsessible so she can actually buy the coat and not just wish for it. Our business is structured that way so that works out very well.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>HB: </strong><strong>Who do you see as the Emerson Fry girl?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>EF: </strong>Our customers are far and wide all over the globe. Many of them are in cities but it's fun to see how they are all coming from diverse backgrounds and how they use the products. The thing they seem to have in common is they are busy, forward-focused and looking for high quality pieces to complement their lifestyles and last long term. Many customers are focused on a less is more asthetic and pieces that are built to reflect confidence and are built to last. We love our customers, they're inspiring and many (I believe) are set to be leaders in the world (if they're not already).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>HB: We found you via a few popular fashion bloggers, you're going a bit viral, what does it mean to you to be discovered this way, so organically?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>EF: </strong>We are always happy when new customers find us and we are honored to make the connection and be of service. Until late 2013 we had done no outreach or marketing, relying mostly on word of mouth. In order to have word of mouth be successful you have to have a positive customer experience. That is what we care about and what they deserve. Our focus is to do our very best to listen observe and respond both to the markets and to each individual customer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>HB: When did you start doing each category (shoes, accessories, rtw?) What prompted that growth?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>EF: </strong>Our first apparell line was in 2010 and for the most part we have had the other accessory categories for many of those seasons. For younger companies accessories can be challenging on the manufacturing side but we've had great luck finding the right producers. In terms of why we did it, its really for the reason that our line and the looks in it would be incomplete without these collections. In terms of bags, we're really excited to release this collection because it really is built to compliment our customers needs: sleek, beautiful, functional, versatile and worthy of longterm investment.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>HB: Where would you like to see Emerson Fry in 5 years?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>EF: </strong>We have gotten the company to a good place and built a solid team. So in that sense, every day is 5 years from now in that we're constantly working to expand modernize and give our customers the best quality and service in the world. There are many exciting things happening now with sustainability, modern tech fabrics, etc, and we hope to take advantage of that. We will just have to see what happens.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.emersonfry.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Emerson Fry" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Emerson Fry</a>'s Spring 2014 collection is on sale now.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/89754333-a030-4699-b9fa-0dfa137fc094_1496780517.jpg alt="Headshot of Kerry Pieri" title="Headshot of Kerry Pieri" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Kerry Pieri is Harper's Bazaar's Digital Fashion/Features Director.
