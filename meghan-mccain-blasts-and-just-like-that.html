In another op-ed for the DailyMail, McCain blasted the latest season of the Sex And The City revival, after saying she had been &#34;lured&#34; back into the series -- which she has slammed in the past -- by the promise of Kim Cattrall's return."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

McCain, who also notes that "they (Che uses plural pronouns) is reduced to nothing more than a stereotype."</p><p>She went on to criticize the show for having "super kinky" and "graphic" intimate scenes between the same pair, calling it "ugly" how their relationship was "solely only defined by sex." McCain then accused the show of "ticking off a woke checklist," with the inclusion of storylines involving more discussion on gender identity and race -- calling the streaming series "nothing more than a 50-year-old progressive white woman's panic attack - a 'Woke for Dummies' guide."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:d07bd0c2-1bb5-4b1f-a9ba-4fd31a1de983 data-container-ref=toofab:article:84400211-ae07-42a4-877d-7f525b916cfa data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c5/5by4/2022/02/21/c5b7394377ca44ea922eee5b12cfa24a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">HBO Max/Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'And Just Like That' Cast Reacts To Meghan McCain's Criticism of Show's 'Wokeness'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>However, McCain had one hope for the show.</p><p>"If anyone can come to the rescue it's Samantha," wrote McCain. "Unfortunately, Cattrall reportedly only makes a small cameo, which was downplayed by Nixon as 'a very small wave at the fans.'"</p><p>Ultimately, McCain said, "But the loyal audience deserves something better than this echo of the original."</p><p>This isn't the first time that McCain has come after the series. Early last year, she posted another essay in which she argued that the revival series' efforts to be more inclusive were a "clumsy attempt to reformat ... into the woke and puritanical times we are living in."</p><p>"Carrie now plays the part of the 'cisgender woman' on a podcast with younger co-hosts. One of them is -- of course -- queer and nonbinary. Because it's so boring and un-evolved to be a straight white woman," she wrote.</p><p>She concluded her op-ed piece with this sentiment: "Wokeness kills everything and I am disappointed to tell you that 'And Just Like That' is another victim of Hollywood trying to placate a specific audience and not the original one, which was made it [sic] a hit in the first place."</p><p>At the time, Nixon responded to McCain's criticism by saying, "We don't want to see these characters … comfortable. We want to see them out of their comfort zones." Added Nicole Ari Parker, "Comments like that say more about the person saying them."</p><p>New episodes of And Just Like That drop Thursdays on Max.</p><a id=gallery-link-2aaba0bc-8c4b-44e1-9947-d688f839380e class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:2aaba0bc-8c4b-44e1-9947-d688f839380e data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:84400211-ae07-42a4-877d-7f525b916cfa data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/02/4by3/2022/10/06/02f8dae158224fef81315cde92fc9ef1_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j29ma2tforKotMCnZKabk5a2r3nBpZisrKNirq%2BwjKOsrKxdobassYytn5qsXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
