CleanFox is an anti-spam and junk email remover to help you <a href=#>tackle everyday overwhelm</a> and eliminate distractions from your digital life.</p><p>The app cleverly detects emails with the lowest open rate by showing emails that you rarely open. This way, you can remove emails that most disturb your productivity first before moving on to emails that may have some importance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For superfast processing, you can swipe in one of three directions: one to permanently delete emails, one to delete an email but receive future updates from the sender, and another to keep receiving emails. You can also switch to a list view which splits emails into three categories: <strong>All</strong>, <strong>Newsletters</strong>, and <strong>Spam</strong>.</p><p>CleanFox lets you add multiple email accounts inside the app, each of which is analyzed separately. There’s also a handy search tool to locate a specific sender instantly. Extra sorting options are available in the list view, enabling you to sort emails by the number received from a sender or by their open rate. With an email app like CleanFox, you won’t have to think twice about creating a clean environment for your Gmail inbox.</p><p><strong>Download</strong>: CleanFox for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Android</a> | <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> (Free)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bulk-delete-emails-in-your-gmail-inbox>3.

Distraction is not the only issue. With limited storage space, you may receive email errors and have interrupted access to edit and create files in collaborative apps such as Google Docs and Sheets.</p><p>Luckily, there is a way to bulk delete emails in Gmail, so you can get your inbox down to zero and <a href=#>simplify your digital life</a>. This method works best in the web version. First, ensure you’re signed in to the correct Google account.</p><p>In the top left corner of your inbox, click the <strong>square checkbox</strong> item. This will select all conversations on the current page. Next, you need to instruct Gmail to select your entire inbox. There is a button to do this called “<strong>Select all conversations in inbox</strong>”, shown below:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/select-all-conversations-button-gmail.jpg><p>Now, you can delete everything. Click the <strong>trash can</strong> icon on the top toolbar to move all your selected emails to the trash folder. If there were some important emails that you deleted, you can access them for up to 30 days in the Trash folder before they’re permanently deleted, so don’t worry. Getting your Gmail inbox to zero is a great step towards <a href=#>achieving digital minimalism</a>, so you can breathe a little.</p><h2 id=condense-emails-into-a-daily-summary-using-slimbox>4.

It also creates a custom label inside Gmail (titled Slimbox), so you can view your email subscriptions at any time.</p><p>Thanks to its daily summaries, you’ll receive one condensed email containing everything you choose to keep, instead of letting constant notifications disrupt your routine. This is a great way to <a href=#>prevent emails from impacting your productivity</a>. Slimbox is free for 30 days before a subscription is required at a generous $1/month.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mark-junk-emails-as-spam-in-gmail>5. Mark Junk Emails as Spam in Gmail</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/suspected-spam-email-in-gmail.jpg><p>While Gmail automatically detects suspicious-looking emails as spam, it’s not 100% accurate. Marking emails as spam helps to keep your inbox safe and prevents you from receiving future unwanted emails.</p><p>Here’s how to mark an email as spam in Gmail:</p><li>Click on the email to mark it as spam.</li><li>On the left side of the top panel, click the button labeled <strong>Report Spam</strong>.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/report-spam-button-in-gmail.jpg></li><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reporting emails as spam will help Gmail detect similar emails in the future, so you can keep a healthy inbox. For a stricter option, you can block a sender. This option will prevent all future emails by the sender from being sent. This is especially useful when you receive too many emails from one source. To block a person on Gmail, click on the three dots menu in the top right corner of an email, then select <strong>Block User</strong>.</p><h2 id=use-search-operators-in-gmail>6. Use Search Operators in Gmail</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/using-search-operators-in-gmail.jpg><p>Gmail’s search operators help you to narrow down types of email by using custom search queries. Using different queries can help you identify types of emails you no longer wish to receive, including spam emails.</p><p>The first way to use search operators is to specify the sender. This way, you can find all unwanted emails sent by one source. You can achieve this using the <strong>from:</strong> command. Simply type the name of the sender after the colon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another way to use operators is by using the <strong>attachment:</strong> command. This helps to identify large emails with attachments you don’t need anymore. You can also search for emails by size by typing the <strong>larger:</strong> command. For instance, you can type <strong>larger: 4MB</strong> to search for all unwanted emails larger than four megabytes in size. Search operators are a great way to manually process unwanted emails without using third-party software.</p><p>Signing up for countless websites has become second nature in today’s society. As a result, it can be nearly impossible to stay on top of your Gmail inbox or clean it up regularly. Thankfully, by using these tips, you can identify junk email without spending hours manually searching.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGifqK9dqbxusMSlnK2dXZ%2FCr7eMppiipF2cuqK1y2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
