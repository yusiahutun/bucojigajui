Who knows how many more jumpsuits Camilla has in her closet?</p><p id=eJvrtSDic-V data-wc=46>The royal is also a fan of chic and floaty kaftans, so it's highly likely that she loves the easy and comfortable silhouette of her jumpsuits. And with her latest outfit's dramatic wide-leg shape, Camilla is certainly making a case for modern style amongst senior royalty.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e3405ce245c5-camilla-jumpsuit-commonwealth-games.jpg><p id=eTlp7dci93N data-wc=24>Her Majesty has a fun sense of fashion and worn many statement looks over the years, from kooky handbags to bold leopard print looks.&nbsp;</p><p id=ebcbQX1cDIR data-wc=15><strong>DON'T MISS:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Charlene of Monaco looks 'unrecognisable' in funky flared trousers and dark hair</a></p><p id=enc5ohjKeJ1 data-wc=44>In fact, Camilla is something of a designer accessory collector, and has carried everything from Bottega Veneta to Chanel and Fendi during her royal career. She is also fond of heritage British brand Launer London, the chosen handbag designer of the late Queen Elizabeth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/41b88c5016f3-camilla-chanel-bag.jpg><p id=ev5y2AUYUpU data-wc=39>The royal loves to add personality to her outfits with her favourite jewels, too, including her gorgeous collection of <a class=hm-link href=#>Van Cleef & Arpels Alhambra pieces</a>, from which she added a chic blue bracelet to her look for Sunday's outing.</p><p id=e2lh059gPq2S data-wc=40>The Queen's Reading Room Literary Festival is one of the first big events Camilla has hosted under her new royal title – the day festival celebrated all things literature and reading, and included a star-studded line-up including Dame Judi Dench.</p><p id=ea92txyr8g9f data-wc=29>Formerly known as The&nbsp;Duchess of Cornwall's&nbsp;Reading&nbsp;Room, Camilla's literacy project was launched back in 2021, when the UK was still in the throws of the coronavirus lockdown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/806ae7759a3f-queen-camilla-dame-judi-dench.jpg><p id=egRy4HjSSpA- data-wc=55>She said at the time: "Ernest Hemingway, famously, once said: 'There is no friend as loyal as a book'. In these challenging times, when we are isolated from the ones we love, many of us are finding comfort in reading, to fire up our imaginations, to take us on journeys and to make us laugh."</p><p id=esPXbbQ-4t data-wc=13><strong>READ NEXT: </strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Eugenie dazzled in the prettiest dress just before giving birth</a></p><p id=eIEwaJIxSU-M data-wc=21>The online reading club has only gone from strength to strength since then, with the festival clearly a hit amongst fans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cb0a0bf1d632-duchess-of-cornwall-reading-room-z.jpg><p id=ewAto7cQDTyD data-wc=100>One visitor wrote on Instagram following the event: "Wow, what an amazing and very special day at the Queen’s Reading Room Festival today. So many special moments including meeting some of our favourite authors including Robert Harris, Kate Mosse and Peter James, and then having the privilege of sitting in an audience with Her Majesty Queen Camilla to watch Gyles Brandreth interview Dame Judi Dench, Ben Elton and Derek Jacobi. A truly magical experience. Listening to Dame Judi and Derek recite Shakespeare from memory will stay with me forever. Thank you so much, already looking forward to the next one."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
