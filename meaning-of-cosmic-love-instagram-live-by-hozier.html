The overall theme of the song can be interpreted as the aftermath of a deep emotional experience, where the narrator feels abandoned, left in darkness, and captivated by the memory of a love that has faded away. The lyrics paint a vivid picture of the emotional journey and inner turmoil that the narrator experiences, ultimately leading them to embrace the darkness rather than flee from it.One of the standout lyrics in the song is "A falling star fell from your heart and landed in my eyes," which metaphorically suggests that the narrator was deeply affected by a love that fell apart. This poignant line highlights the vulnerability of the narrator and their willingness to open themselves up to love, despite the eventual pain and blindness it caused. The theme developed here revolves around the idea of love being a powerful force that can blind us to reality, leaving us in a state of emotional disarray.Another significant lyric is "No dawn, no day, I'm always in this twilight, in the shadow of your heart." This line encapsulates the lingering presence of the past love in the narrator's life, as if their world has been perpetually cast in a shadow. It explores the theme of obsession and the inability to move forward, as the narrator finds themselves trapped in the remnants of a love that is no longer reciprocated.The image of darkness is prevalent throughout the song, with lines like "But then it stopped, and I was in the darkness, so darkness I became." This lyric suggests that the narrator's emotional journey has led them to embrace the darkness within themselves. It explores the theme of transformation through pain and the idea that sometimes, from the depths of despair, one can find strength and a new sense of self.The celestial imagery present in the lyrics, such as "The stars, the moon, they have all been blown out," adds an ethereal quality to the song. It symbolizes the collapse of the narrator's world and the fading of the love they once held dear. This theme of cosmic love implies that love itself can have a cosmic significance, reaching beyond the confines of time and space.Overall, 'Cosmic Love (Instagram Live)' delves into the complex nature of love, its aftermath, and the profound impact it can have on an individual. The lyrics in this song capture the raw emotions of heartbreak, obsession, and the resilience found in embracing darkness. It's a reminder that even in our darkest moments, we can find strength and beauty, as love's remnants continue to shape us.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufonypu9minKtnnZqur7XNoGSonl2YvLS5yJxkpaemmnqqutKtmKCqkaJ6rbXVnmSbsV2dvLu1xKs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
