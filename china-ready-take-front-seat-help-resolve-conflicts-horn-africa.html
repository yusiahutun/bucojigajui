HK mediation centre to bolster China’s influence in Africa
That approach was apparent in the Ethiopian conflict.
For example, China supported the Ahmed government as the country faced mounting pressure from Western countries over alleged human rights violations committed by Ethiopian forces in Tigray."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Sudan and Egypt have said that using water from the Blue Nile – on which Egypt is heavily dependent – to fill the Ethiopian dam could lower the river’s water levels.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But so far China has also avoided the role of mediator among rivals Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nantulya said China had instead held separate talks with each country, urging them to avoid military options.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As part of those discussions, China has promised huge economic investments to incentivise them to dial down the pressure while continuing to look to China as a preferred partner.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“China is likely to continue relying on targeted economic and financial partnerships as an indirect means of reducing conflict rather than direct mediation,” Nantulya said. He said China was focused on extending its Belt and Road Initiative into the region as a kind of “peace dividend”.</p>Under its multibillion-dollar <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Belt and Road Initiative</span></a>, China has already funded and built huge infrastructure projects in the region, including a railroad from Djibouti to the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China has also poured money into Djibouti’s maritime sector, including the country’s ports and free-trade zones, and built its first overseas military base near the strategic Bab el-Mandeb strait between the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lukas Fiala, the coordinator of the China Foresight project at the London School of Economics, said China had been involved in the diplomatic dispute surrounding the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam in the sense that Chinese companies helped build the project.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fiala said that given China’s existing interests in the Horn – extensive investments in Ethiopia and neighbouring countries, close bilateral partnerships with regional governments, and a growing security presence in Djibouti, “Beijing is surely keen for regional parties to find a way to de-escalate tensions”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Yet, politically, China has not been as active as one might expect. China surely wants to appear as a constructive diplomatic actor in the region, but China’s Horn of Africa envoy Xue Bing has, at least publicly, largely avoided tackling the issue of the [dam] head-on. China likely wants to avoid alienating any of the regional parties involved – Sudan, Ethiopia and Egypt,” Fiala said.</p>He said China’s diplomatic experiences in the context of the Darfur war in Sudan and the civil war in South Sudan had shaped <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Beijing’s subsequent engagement</span></a> in places along the belt and road routes.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yet, broadly speaking, “China prefers to set the table rather than the agenda, delegating the substance of mediation to regional, African parties”, Fiala said<strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelnyltc%2BlpqaZk658or7TopqlnV9of3F8lXJvaJuYnruiedGemJ2xXamurLGMn6mopqRiwKat02afnqSgYr%2Bmv86lrZ5lk6S7p7jInKusZZikv695wJ%2BpopuR</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
