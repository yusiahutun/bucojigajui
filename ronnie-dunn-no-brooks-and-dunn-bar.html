Ronnie Dunn wrote a song called &#34;Rodeo Man,&#34; which Garth Brooks heard and wanted to record, with his pal Dunn as a featured artist.
Taste of Country Nights had a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to sit down in the recording studio with Brooks and Dunn — Garth, that is.
Brooks is on the cusp of opening his Friends in Low Places Bar in Nashville later this month, and I found it interesting that Brooks & Dunn — the real '90s duo — don't already have their own bar and venue."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"We're just afraid to be in the bar business. We don't have as much money as Garth. (Garth laughs). He can sneak around and take a risk that we can't."</p><p>Brooks, on the other hand, is all for it, chiming in: "A Brooks & Dunn bar, we need it. Just do a license deal where it doesn't cost you any money."</p><p>"OK, sounds like a good business to be in. You front the money," Dunn jokes.</p><p>Brooks' soon-to-open Friends in Low Places venue has multiple levels to part on once you're inside, so I suggested that the "Shameless" star might give up a floor to his friends Brooks & Dunn.</p><p>To that, he says, "Hell no!"</p><p>"There's not a building in town tall enough to take care of his business," Dunn adds.</p><p>Brooks&nbsp;jokes that&nbsp;the sixth floor of his new establishment could be the Brooks&nbsp;and Dunn floor, which the two country music icons got a big chuckle over.</p><p>"Rodeo Man" is streaming now on all platforms now, as well as playing nightly on Taste of Country Nights.&nbsp;Brooks'&nbsp;Friends in Low Places bar officially opens on the day after Thanksgiving with an <a href=#>epic live performance</a>.</p><p>Evan Paul is the host of&nbsp;<a class="x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0" title="Original URL: https://tasteofcountry.com/category/taste-of-country-nights/.

The kitchen includes marble countertops, while skylights offer plenty of natural California sunlight. The den features floor-to-ceiling bookshelves on either side of a fireplace of white brick.</p><p>The backyard is spectacular, featuring a loggia, an outdoor fireplace, a half-court basketball court and elaborate landscaping. The house provides direct access to the world-famous Malibu beach via a set of steps.</p><p>The couple sold the house in Malibu in late 2016 for $7 million.</p><p class=photogallery-credit>Gallery Credit: <a href=#>Sterling Whitaker</a></p><h2 class=photogallery-title>See 50 Essential '90s Country Songs</h2><p>If you call yourself a real fan of '90s country music, you probably need to know the words to all of these hit songs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmq6eeo7amecOupadlnqR6o77OqKKsZZGjsW6w1KelZpqRp3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
