These teams of two participated in six intense races over 40 days without planes, trains, and automobiles to help them get around. Infact, they had to endure more than 100 miles of inhospitable, previously unexplored terrain on the strength of their own two feet with nothing but only what they can carry.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, this meant Cason had to utilize his primitive survival skills to source his own food, water, and shelter. Moreover, being on the dangerous Alaskan coastline, marked by its sprawling mountain ranges, ancient glaciers, suffocating rainforests, and threatening wildlife, certainly didn’t make things easier.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Joining Cason and Bella for the inaugural season of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Race to Survive Alaska</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> were their co-stars Jeff and Hunter Leininger (father-son duo), Robin Moore and Elizabeth Killham (friends and adventurers), Brett Gattenand Esther Sanderlin (Alaskan hunters), Wilson and Oliver Hoogendorn (siblings), and Max Djenohan and Christian Junkar (reality stars and friends).</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Cason Crane Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Cason Crane flaunted a net worth of above $750 thousand in 2023.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He is an adventurer and the founder of</span><i><span style=font-weight:400> Explorer Cold Brew</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (the world’s first premium cold brew that lets you choose your caffeine level) and </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Rainbow Summits Project</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Through </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Rainbow Summits Project</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, Cason became the fifth youngest and first openly LGBT person to climb Mt. Everest and the Seven Summits (the highest mountain on each continent). He even raised $135,000 for youth suicide prevention and crisis intervention thanks to this feat.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>After making a name for himself, Cason then joined </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Princeton University</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and graduated four years later with a degree in History and certificates in American Studies and Near Eastern Studies in 2017. Since graduation, Cason has continued to satisfy his craving for exploration and won several prize-winning finishes in ultramarathon and obstacle course races.
