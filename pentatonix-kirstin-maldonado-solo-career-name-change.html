Hear Their Heartfelt Plea</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Maldonado says so far her solo career has proved to be demanding as it’s up to her to “take the reins and lead the ship” — but she says she passed controls over to a wedding planner leading up to her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>November nuptials</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I couldn’t handle it myself because I was getting anxiety,” she said of the planning. “I can’t wait. I’m really excited … everything is coming into place.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It was in Paris while Maldonado was on tour with Pentatonix that now-fiancé Jeremy Michael Lewis — whom she met in 2013 on The Sing Off — got down on one knee.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I think what’s really beautiful about us is that he brings me up so much,” she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>previously told PEOPLE in an exclusive announcement of her engagement</a>. “The second I met him, I was so inspired by who he was as a person. We both bring wonderful qualities to each other and that’s so important.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Maldonado isn’t the first Pentatonix member to pursue individual careers. She actually sees herself as a late bloomer compared to the rest of her band mates.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’m the last one to leave the nest in terms of solo endeavors, but I’m glad I waited,” she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Her experience with the group — which has racked up several Grammys and more than two billion YouTube views — is giving her a head start with her solo career, making her more confident in the industry she’s already spent years mastering.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Being in Pentatonix the last couple of years has definitely helped me feel more comfortable in this space, knowing what I want and being able to communicate with everyone,” she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>FROM PEN: Grammy News and Notes: Album of the Year Nominees</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And relax, PTX fans — Maldonado’s solo career does not mean an end for Pentatonix. The group (sans Avi Kaplan, who <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>said in May</a> that he was “taking a step back”) is still scheduled to tour later this year.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Alternating between solo and group mentalities may have Maldonado “juggling two lives,” but she says it is motivating, not daunting.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I feel like I have to be on my game because I have to handle my solo stuff and Pentatonix stuff, so it has really kept me on my toes in a good way,” she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ52qwKqvjqmcp6yRqbyvtddmoqKqo6m2r3nMmqOdp56WsbB50qijqGWTlr%2BmsdFmpZqllWKwqa3NoJxo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
