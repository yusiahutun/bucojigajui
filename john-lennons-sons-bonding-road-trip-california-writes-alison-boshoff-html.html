His secret family first came to light in 1966 when Cynthia was photographed pushing a pram. Months later, the marriage was doomed when John met Yoko Ono at an art show.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He moved to New York with Yoko when Julian was just five years old and made a cruelly distant parent. Birthday and Christmas presents were dispatched, unseen by him, from The Beatles' London office.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Julian was taunted at school for having 'walls papered with £5 notes' but, in fact, he and Cynthia had no material wealth, and he had next to no contact with John.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When he was 11, Julian was sent to New York for a few, awkward meetings — Julian estimates he saw his father ten times in all.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I lived from birthdays to Christmas, just to be with him,' he said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The visits themselves were filled with erratic incidents. Once, John scolded Julian, telling him not to laugh so loudly as he might wake baby Sean.

Julian said: 'When I saw the fact that, you know, he'd basically given up music for a couple of years to look after Sean, you know, that was — it was hurtful. I thought, 'Well, why didn't he do that for me?' I was a bit jealous, but I never said anything.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In another interview, he said he was angry about the neglect. 'I felt he was a hypocrite. Dad could talk about peace and love to the world, but that peace and love never came home to me.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In 1980, John was gunned down by Mark Chapman. It was a shattering blow.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Julian was put on Concorde to New York. There, he found Yoko's grief hard to handle. She had wanted to wait until Julian arrived to tell Sean about John's death, and she wanted Julian's advice on breaking the news.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Over and over, they rehearsed what Yoko would say. 'I remember seeing the glint in Sean's eye, when he actually understood what had happened.

I think the key point to all this, for me at least, has been Sean. If I hurt Sean's mother, then I hurt Sean.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It's a roundabout way of thinking about things. But because I love Sean so much, I just don't want to hurt him. I can get over it. Have gotten over it.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>With homes in Monaco, France, LA and London, Julian drifted from place to place, holidaying with wealthy and well-connected friends.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He resurfaced in 1998 with an album called Photograph Smile. It was a modest success — but it was outshone by Sean's first album, Into The Sun, which came out in the same month. Julian was sure it wasn't a coincidence, and thought Yoko was behind the clash.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He also complained that three or four years could go by without contact from his brother. 'If I move, I always give Sean my new number. I call him from time to time, but I never get a return call,' he said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was 2006 when, after some prodding from Cynthia, the two men spent a few hours together in Los Angeles.</p><img id=i-c28223dcfcfd7e19 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/11/22/22/50839781-10231701-image-a-35_1637619387099.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="Julian and Sean attended the premiere of the Disney+ film Get Back, about the Beatles breakup" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Julian and Sean attended the premiere of the Disney+ film Get Back, about the Beatles breakup</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They found that they had much in common and, in 2007, went to Boujis nightclub in London's Kensington.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Then, when Sean was playing in Prague later that year, Julian joined the tour unannounced and stayed on the musicians' bus as it moved through Croatia and Slovenia.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Sean said: 'How sweet is that? I am totally thrilled and deeply touched by this. It's really fun having him on the bus. It's nice to have some quality time with him. None of my friends are willing to rough it on the tour bus, so I am very impressed.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>That contact continued after the tour and, by 2010, Sean attended the opening of an exhibition of photographs by Julian with Yoko. Cynthia said that night: 'I've never seen my son so happy as he is now.' Julian chimed in: 'There's a lot of forgiveness now.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Sean has continued to make music and tour, and Julian has moved into photographic and philanthropic work. He runs The White Feather Foundation, which works on environmental and humanitarian issues, and is behind a scholarship dedicated to women's education founded in his mother's memory. Cynthia died in 2015. He's also written children's books.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Both men go out of their way to support one another, and thoroughly enjoy each other's company.
