Books that claim to be based on real-life principles of <a href=#>psychology</a> that promise to teach you how to excel at life, attract millions of people across the globe.&nbsp;It seems like we all crave to be influenced; to have someone to look up to that can teach us how to manoeuvre through this rather difficult path of life. But, are these “influencers” that we look up to really all that great? Can they be trusted with all of their allure and seeming greatness?&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, self-help guru Jay Shetty has come under scrutiny- he has been accused of lying about his journey as a monk and also accused of plagiarism by a UK-based Journalist.&nbsp;</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Jay Shetty and His Claims</h4><p>Jay Shetty is a British-Indian author, podcast host, and former monk. He gained popularity through his inspirational videos and content on social media platforms, particularly on YouTube and Instagram. Shetty’s content often focuses on personal development, <a href=#>mindfulness</a>, and spirituality, drawing from his experiences as a monk and his studies in psychology and philosophy.</p><p>His story, as he so claims, is that after graduation, he spent 3 years in India as a monk forgoing a life of material success. The story further goes on as he highlights another reflection which enlightened him to his true purpose which was then using his skills and his supposed wisdom to help guide people and put them on the right path.</p><p>What makes his claims even more fishy is that he often offers changed versions of the story. Somehow, Shetty happened to span over three years of age as he constantly switches between the ages of 18, 21, or 22 in regards to when he first heard the monk’s lecture.&nbsp;</p><p>But, sources have said that he spent only a few months in India, and instead was living in Watford, an orbital town outside north-west London. He was associated with the infamous ISKCON (International Society for Krishna Consciousness), which he never mentions, possibly because of the organization’s controversial past.&nbsp;</p><p>The chronology of the events that took place also seems a bit haphazard. Official sources have pointed out that the lecture with the monk took place in 2007, and videographic evidence of a young Shetty in France interacting with monks of ISKON.&nbsp;</p><p>Another video dated to 2006 shows a young Shetty partaking in a kirtan led by Gauranga Das, the very monk who gave the lecture a year later, in 2007. Shetty has never spoken of this previous interaction with the monk or his involvement with the faith even though his attorneys now claim he has been a part of it since childhood.</p><p>Shetty has recounted over and over again that he spent three years as a monk in a village near Mumbai under the guidance of his teacher, Gauranga Das, who then led him to his second revelation.&nbsp;</p><p>However, sources have confirmed that Shetty was actually in Bhaktivedanta Manor in Watford which is in England. While his attorneys claim that Shetty was only at the manor for 3 months before moving to India, Shetty’s blogs have asserted that during the period of those 3 years, Shetty moved around Europe and India but his primary spot of stay was at the Bhaktivedanta Manor.</p><p>Despite Shetty’s numerous claims that his 3 years of being a monk were entirely untouched by worldly life, he spent those three years attempting to make viral reels on the streets of London. For a supposed monk, he surely spent a lot of time online. Shetty himself in videos he posted online has said his goal is “to bring Krishna consciousness to the Apple Generation” but at the beginning of his famous book, he states “This is not a conversion strategy, I swear!”.&nbsp;</p><p>He is also accused of plagiarising his motivational speeches as a supposed life coach. Furthermore, there are multiple allegations against Shetty regarding stealing content without mentioning the original creators or giving them any sort of credit.&nbsp;</p><p>His huge Instagram and YouTube empire is based on people getting influenced by his speeches, which he has carefully copied and pasted onto his account. What Shetty has called helping people can be subtly seen as Multi-level marketing as his businesses grow with his popularity.</p><p>If we look at the Jay Shetty Certification school, it claims that the exam certification conducted by the school is approved by Ofqual which is the organisation responsible for regulation of all examinations for England-based schools. However, officials from Ofqual have denied any such association with the school and have demanded the school remove any sort of references to Ofqual.</p><p>While the school funds the OTHM (a private exam certification company) to aid its accreditation, and OTHM is approved by Ofqual, OTHM officials have called out the Shetty schools for not having any links to Ofqual-approved OTHM qualifications.</p><p>Shetty has garnered a platform that sees him as an authority on mental health issues and tips. However, according to a previous romantic connection of Shetty’s, Lila, who happens to be a practising psychotherapist has called out Shetty for exaggerating his credits and knowledge on the subject.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>It’s Impact</h4><p>At a time when we are so deeply persuaded by all these influencers and self-help gurus, it is important to evaluate and assess who is being truthful about their journeys. We all want to follow the path of these enlightened people who have attained nirvana- but it is important not to let them make a fool of us. Many of them use their platforms and their outreach to leech money and expand their lifestyles.</p><p>Jay Shetty is also one of them. His followers have paid a significant amount of money to get a Postgraduate Diploma from The Jay Shetty Certification School. His books continue to sell out worldwide and he has amassed a huge following on multiple social media platforms. Celebrities have also been influenced.&nbsp;From interviewing Will Smith on his podcast to appearing on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” to discuss mindfulness, Shetty’s interactions with celebrities have spanned a wide spectrum. He also Officiated the wedding of two A-List Hollywood Stars, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck.</p><p>His followers also seem unfazed- they refuse to hear any backlash against their Guru; this all-rightful man who is so spiritually wise that he simply cannot be wrong.&nbsp;This news should act as a reminder to Take away whatever positive teachings they propagate but don’t put influencers on a pedestal. Learn to not play into their agendas and have your agency.&nbsp;</p><span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">News</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Reading & Math Science Enhance English Learners’ Performance:</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 2, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">News</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>During the perimenopause, women are 40% more prone</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 1, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">News</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Uncategorized</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Bomb Threat in Delhi-NCR Schools: It Can Cause</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 1, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">News</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Raghav Juyal advocates for stopping plastic pollution, Urges</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 1, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Motivation</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">News</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Appearance over Achievement?: UP Board Topper Trolled for</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 1, 2024<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sb%2FYnJ%2BopJ%2BcwG%2BvzqZmoqtdn666edKhnK2sqah6tLHLn2ShnZyleqa5z6KpnmWSqratwIyopWaekaHApnnCpZiipaNk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
