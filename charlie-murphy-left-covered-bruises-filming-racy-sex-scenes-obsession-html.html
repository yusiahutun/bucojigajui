There was no give in that hardwood - it was not great… My bruises were on my knees, my toes, elbows, all the bony bits!'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Peaky Blinders star also revealed she and Richard eorked with a 'touch map' with the intimacy co-ordinator and discussed where they were OK with being touched ahead of filming.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said: 'They set up the atmosphere of consent and boundaries. And we do a touch map all over your body and we would work through, "okay, I'm happy being touched there. I'm happy being touched there, but not there."&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'And it can be the side of your arm, it can be anything. We're all just humans coming to set and we don't know what someone's been through or you know, what makes them uncomfortable.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'And we work out all of that and then we find a map [of the body] that we are safe to use. And then we work through the physical physicality of each scene and we choreograph the actual sex itself…&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I did feel very empowered because we had done the homework and I felt like, "oh, I'm doing something as it's supposed to have been done."'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Charlie said she has on occasion felt regret over some of the sex scenes she has filmed in the past due to a lack of control.</p><img id=i-8cb5c1336329bafe src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/04/18/15/69959859-11986105-image-a-16_1681827480874.jpg height=536 width=634 alt="Plot: In the series, Charlie plays Anna, a woman who embarks on an affair with her fiancé Jay's father William (Richard Armitage)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Plot: In the series, Charlie plays Anna, a woman who embarks on an affair with her fiancé Jay's father William (Richard Armitage)</p><img id=i-1f34afe8132b6612 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/04/18/15/69959871-11986105-image-a-17_1681827525944.jpg height=951 width=634 alt="Story: Will gradually becomes obsessed with Anna over the course of the fourt-part show, with the pair partaking in a BDSM-fuelled relationship" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Story: Will gradually becomes obsessed with Anna over the course of the fourt-part show, with the pair partaking in a BDSM-fuelled relationship</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said: 'I've done a lot of sex scenes, nothing that I've ever been upset over, but sometimes at the end of the day, felt a tinge of regret or a tinge of, "oh God, that's in the can and that's out of my control now."</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I felt in control and that's empowering and fun. We had a lot of fun on set. We had a lot of fun because we felt protected…&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Richard [Armitage] was saying, and he did say it early on in, in our rehearsal, "let's just do as the French do and not be so scared or embarrassed by our bodies." We all have our bits!'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Charlie also admitted that she would havebeen nervous to film a show like Obsession before the Me-Too movement.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said: 'In that climate? Yeah, definitely. It just wouldn't have been the same show because we felt very relaxed and it would've been shocking to have that kind of script executed the way that we did it… I think it would've been a very different show.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Charlie is arguably best known for her role as Ann Gallagher in Happy Valley and she has also recently starred in the TV shows Deadline and The Capture.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-5722406eb3c6b77f src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/04/18/15/69960779-11986105-image-a-18_1681827603077.jpg height=447 width=634 alt="Charlie said:&nbsp;'We were covered, covered in bruises.

There was no give in that hardwood - it was not great… My bruises were on my knees, my toes, elbows, all the bony bits!'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The star said she has learned much more about herself during quieter periods of her career rather than when she's working consistently.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She explained: 'I've definitely learned a lot more from failure. You get to really know yourself when you're unemployed and when you're getting all of those no’s in a row for tapes from meetings, it's really hard.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I wish and would love to say to actors that, "your success should not be wrapped up in your self-worth." And I'm still trying to say that to myself.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'So it's very much a work in progress. You do learn a lot about yourself when you're watching Cash in the Addict on repeat in your PJs and I just go, "I need to break into mom and dad's house and see what's up in that attic. I'm an out of work actor. I need to flog some stuff here!"'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Obsession is a four part series and is available to watch on Netflix now.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKymqLWww8GisWiZoqm2pLjEZmhqcWhrfnGBjnyfmqqcnrJumdSrp6GxXaGyp8CMnKavnaKasW6u0a6grJ2jYrOquMyipaBlopawunnSnq9mq5Oau6a%2FjIiZrJ2jqLawuo2hq6ak</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
