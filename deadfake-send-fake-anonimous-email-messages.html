They each have slightly different features and use cases.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Keep reading to learn about seven of the best prank email generators and how you can use them to make an email look like it was sent from someone else.</p><h2 id=deadfake>1. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadfake</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/3-2.jpg><p>Deadfake is one of the most well-known prank email generators on the web. This fake email sender has been responsible for sending over two million fake email messages since it first went online.</p><p>Deadfake lets you send fake emails to anyone you want. Better yet, you can make the email appear that it's from any person of your choosing as well.</p><p>To aid anonymity, you don't need to register on the site or provide your personal details to Deadfake to use the service.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When creating your fake email, you can format it using the native text editor. Make sure you use a real domain in the <strong>From</strong> field, or the email will bounce, and your attempts to make an email look like it was sent from someone else will fail.</p><h2 id=emkei-39-s-mailer>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emkei's Mailer</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2-2.jpg><p>Emkei's Mailer provides a similar service to Deadfake. It offers a full range of options for the emails you send. You can choose the From Name, From Email, To, Subject, and Message.</p><p>The most significant difference between the two services is Emkei's Mailer's support for attachments. As per most email services, the maximum attachment size is 25MB.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Emkei's Mailer also offers a plain text editor and an HTML editor while you're composing your message. As such, the app is simple to use for a quick one-liner, but can also be deployed when you want to make a fake email message look a bit more convincing.</p><h2 id=anonymouse>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anonymouse</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1-2.jpg><p>Anonymouse is another site that allows you to send an email from a fake address. With its AnonEmail service, the site generates a fake email address for you, which you can then use to send your prank email.</p><p>To increase anonymity, Anonymouse randomly delays your sent email up to 12 hours. This way, you can be sending a fake email to your friend in the same room, but your target prank victim won't immediately suspect you because they won't receive the email until much later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=send-anonymous-email>4. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Send Anonymous Email</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/4-2.jpg><p>Send Anonymous Email is a web app that can make an email look like it was sent from someone else. The site claims more than 60,000 anonymous emails get sent from its servers every day. That number sounds high to us, but it's clearly a widely-used app regardless of the real figure.</p><p>The service's options and features are the least extensive of the three sites on the list so far. You can only specify the receiver's email, sender's email, subject, and message. There are no attachments, and only a standard plain text editor is available.</p><p>You cannot add colors, change the font, or fiddle with other formatting options. You'll need to enter the security code before Send Anonymous Email will let you send your fake message.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's worth noting that Send Anonymous Email takes a serious stance on abuse of its services. In the company's terms, it says if you send death threats, abuse, slander, or anything illegal, the company will publish your IP address and block you from the site.</p><p>The same company provides additional services for sending anonymous or fake SMS messages.</p><h2 id=anonymailer>5. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anonymailer</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/5-2.jpg><p>Anoymailer is another fake mail sender. You can use it to send fake mail to all your friends and family (and even unsuspecting co-workers!). It's probably best not to send them to people you don't know, though. Anonymailer does not support bulk emails or email attachments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, however, this service adds a header signature to all the emails that you send. That's sure to give the game away. There is a pro version of the app, but you will need to pay $97 to send 140 emails for a seven-day period.</p><p>Pranks aren't limited to fake emails, so you can also check out several <a href=#>geeky prank sites to fool your friends</a> for more free options!</p><h2 id=zmail>6. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ZMail</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/6.jpg><p>ZMail provides a unique way to send fake emails or play an email spam prank. That's because it is the only service on our list that works via a desktop app rather than via a web app.</p><p>Don't worry; you don't need to fret about viruses and malware. ZMail is open source; meaning anyone can check out the code to make sure it's safe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sadly, the app is only available on Windows. Mac users will have to stick to one of the web apps we have discussed. For iPhone users, you can look up <a href=#>dedicated iPhone apps to prank your friends</a> in the App Store.</p><h2 id=guerrillamail>7. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GuerrillaMail</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/guerrillamail-670x342.png><p>None of the services we've looked at so far will allow you to receive email replies; they do not provide an inbox service.</p><p>However, some services–such as GuerrillaMail–do provide an email inbox and can be used to send a fake email. But there is a trade-off. You cannot send the fake email from someone else; GuerrillaMail does not let you add a custom <strong>From</strong> address. You can set any username you wish, but are restricted to one of the app's preselected domains.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Furthermore, emails in the inbox are only saved for 60 minutes. Thereafter, GuerrillaMail will automatically delete the messages from its servers. If you don't regularly check for responses to your prank, you risk missing the fallout altogether.</p><h2 id=letter-generator>8. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Letter Generator</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/7.jpg><p>We'll leave you with something a bit different. Letter Generator lets you generate fake letters using topics and keywords of your choosing.</p><p>The service is the perfect app to use when you're not sure what to write in your fake prank email. Pair this app with one of the fake email services we've already discussed, and you've got a winning prank on your hands.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The topics available include employment, relationships, apartment rentals, and even song lyrics. Letter Generator is entirely free to use, and there are no restrictions on the number of letters you can generate.</p><p>If you prefer generated pranks rather than creating your own from start to finish, these <a href=#>popular prank call websites</a> and their variety of topics should also suit your purpose.</p><h2 id=use-fake-email-generators-responsibly>Use Fake Email Generators Responsibly</h2><p>Services that let you send fake emails can easily be abused. The act of sending a fake email from someone else raises ethical and moral concerns. And depending on the content of your message (and the actions the recipients take in light of it), there could even be legal consequences.</p><p>Sure, fake emails can provide a bit of fun among family and friends. But don't send prank emails that could cause alarm, sadness, or panic. And it goes without saying that you shouldn't impersonate the police or other emergency services. And if you're looking for inspiration, old tech pranks could be a good bet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9fmbKisMWaop5lo5q7pXnFmqKeZZGjvK%2B1zKisrGWVoq6quIymnKyrkZyytHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
