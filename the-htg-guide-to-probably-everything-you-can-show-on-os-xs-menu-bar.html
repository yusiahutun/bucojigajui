It really is an OS relic that just keeps going and going and going.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/img_5556b4fc01199.png><p>Of course, the menu bar has changed and its function has evolved, but the basics are all still there and it very much looks the same as it did back in 1984.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/img_5556b606c64da.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Today, the menu bar lets you add all kinds of extra functionality to it. You can easily check your&nbsp;Mac's energy status (particularly helpful if you're using a laptop), or you can&nbsp;<a href=#>start Time Machine backups</a>, or log into another account with&nbsp;fast user switching, etc.</p><p>In fact, many of the System Preferences have icons you can add, and many applications will also use the menu bar so users have&nbsp;convenient access to features and functions.</p><p>In this article, we're going to show and talk about all the different things you can add to the menu bar using only what you'll find in the system preferences. This includes not only the things&nbsp;we've already mentioned, but all the other preference menu bar items we could find.</p><p>It's helpful to know all about these because if you hold the "Command" key down, you can move and rearrange them. If you drag one out of the menu bar it will be removed. If you didn't mean to do that, or want it back, then here's how to restore it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=left-to-right-top-to-bottom>Left to Right, Top to Bottom</h2><p>These are&nbsp;our System Preferences as they appear on an early 2014 Macbook Air running Yosemite (10.10.3).

There may also be a fifth row (not pictured) with third-party applications and utilities, if you have installed any.</p><p>We're going to go through each row, from top to bottom and talk about every system preference that has any kind of menu bar extensibility options.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=personal-preferences>Personal Preferences</h2><p>The personal preferences consist mainly of things that will appeal to your OS X use and sense of style.

If you want to turn this off, then uncheck the box next to "Enable location services".</p><h2 id=hardware-preferences>Hardware Preferences</h2><p>The second row consists of all things hardware-related. If you need to change how your laptop consumes energy on battery, or the way the keyboard or trackpad behaves, or all things printer-related, the Hardware preferences are the place to go.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/img_5557942d568ac.png><p>Of the seven items on the Hardware preferences, we're going to focus on Displays, Energy Saver, Keyboard, and Sound.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=displays>Displays</h3><p>The Displays preferences allow you to change stuff with your system's displays, both built-in and attached.

On the "Keyboard" tab, you can elect to "Show Keyboard & Character Viewers".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/img_55579bf4e97c3.png><p>With the keyboard and character viewers enabled, you gain&nbsp;easy access to&nbsp;the onscreen keyboard, symbols, arrows, and more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/img_5557b043f2222.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here we see both as they might appear on your display.
