Now she’s debuted the "Burning House" music video to accompany the touching ballad, and it's as poignant as it is visually stunning.</p><p>Cam's "Burning House" video&nbsp;features a literal burning house, as the singer, dressed in an angelic pure white dress, explores the disintegrating structure engulfed in flames. Cam has explained in the past the meaning behind the metaphor, referencing a real-life relationship that didn’t end well.</p><p>"I had a fella that I dated on-again, off-again in college, and towards the end of the relationship, I wanted to get out and I didn't do it very nice," Cam explains to <a href=#>ET</a>. "I was gonna see him about a year or two later at a mutual friend's party, and I thought, 'This is my chance to apologize.'"</p><p>"I thought so much about how I was gonna put that apology before that party, that night before I went to bed with all that on my mind, I dreamt about this house," the newcomers&nbsp;continues. "It was on fire and all the rescue crews were out and they couldn't put out the fire. They were saying, 'He's in there, but you can't go in there. The house is about to come down.' And, like the hero I am, I ran inside and he was in there."</p><p>"Instead of leaving and saving myself, I just laid down next to him and held him so he wouldn't have to die alone," she says.</p><p>If that&nbsp;doesn’t stir your heart at least a tiny bit when watching this video, nothing will.&nbsp;Cam didn’t take any shortcuts when filming — the flames were very much real, and her dress even caught on fire.</p><p>"It's been a crazy day,” she dished in a behind-the-scenes segment with ET. "From puffy sleeves that got removed on the dress, to flaming cocktails bursting, and then lighting my dress on fire. ... I just did a walk up the stairs, and the carpet caught on fire. We're really lucky everything seems to be okay&nbsp;and it's going to turn out beautiful."</p><p>Firefighters were on standby during the entire shoot keeping the blaze under control, so the star was protected from any real danger.</p><p>“Burning House” was also <a href=#>certified gold by the RIAA</a>&nbsp;recently, marking the sales of 500,000 copies. Though she has penned songs for artists like <a href=#>Maggie Rose</a> and <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> in the past, Cam's&nbsp;EP, Welcome to Cam Country, is her first foray into the business as a solo artist. She is reportedly working on a full length album with her label, Arista (part of Sony Nashville), home to a few somewhat recognizable names like&nbsp;<a href=#>Carrie Underwood</a> and <a href=#>Brad Paisley</a>. She’s currently on the road with <a href=#>Chase Rice</a> as part of his JD and Jesus&nbsp;Tour, which kicked off this month.</p><p><strong>More Country Artists Who Got Engaged or Married in 2015</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnJmdYq%2B2vs2ipaBlmKTCtLGMr6CdnZ9k</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
