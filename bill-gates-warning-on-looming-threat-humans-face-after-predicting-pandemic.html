Gates talks about the positive changes that have happened over the years while ideating how to tackle the future.</p><p>“I think we’re at a crucial moment. I’ve seen exciting progress in the more than 15 years that I’ve been learning about energy and climate change. The cost of renewable energy from the sun and wind has dropped dramatically. There’s more public support for taking big steps to avoid a climate disaster than ever before. And governments and companies around the world are setting ambitious goals for reducing emissions. What we need now is a plan that turns all this momentum into practical steps to achieve our big goals. That’s what&nbsp;How to Avoid a Climate Disaster&nbsp;is: a plan for eliminating greenhouse gas emissions,” he<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> said</a> in 2021.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-we-are-at-a-halfway-point-for-the-global-sustainable-development-goals>We are at a “halfway point for the global Sustainable Development Goals”</h2><p>Bill Gates is currently in NYC to talk about climate change and more in UNGA 2023 and he is reminding us about global Sustainable Development Goals and what has been achieved at a halfway point.</p><p>In the latest Gates <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a>, Bill and Melinda write: “2023 marks the halfway point for the successors to the Millennium Development Goals—the Sustainable Development Goals. The ambition was to end all preventable child deaths by 2030, and to cut the maternal mortality rate to less than 70 out of every 100,000 births. We are far off track on both goals—but that doesn’t have to be the case.”</p><p>While the progress rate is much slower, all hope is not lost just yet as they recall the revolutionary changes healthcare has seen in the past decade saying, “In the 2010s, just as the problem was about to get worse, it also became more solvable. Doctors uncovered revolutionary information about maternal and child health—everything from the exact diseases that are killing children, to the role anemia can play in increasing blood loss during childbirth, to previously unknown ways in which a baby’s health is linked to their mother’s.”</p><p>Bill Gates is urging us to see the changes that need to happen in healthcare and climate talks and we are looking forward to seeing what the founder of Microsoft has in store next.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlxX2d9cK7IpaNmn5GpsrR51pqpp6GenHqwuoylpqilmaO0bsDHq5yarF2dwq6tzaxkn5mTmnqistOeqWaoopqxqq%2FToqWgZaCWu6WxzKKaaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
