Just like your favorite winter blanket or winter comforter, finding the coziest sheets around can mean the difference between a great night’s sleep and a chilly evening spent tossing and turning. But with all the different fabrics and thread counts available, how do you know which ones you’ll like best? Let’s break it down.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to Choose the Best Sheets for Winter</h2><p>There are two things people immediately look for when shopping for sheets: thread count and fabric.</p>Read More<p>Let’s start with thread counts. A sheet’s <a href=#>thread count</a> is “a sum of the number of threads per inch both lengthwise and widthwise,” according to Sleep.org. That means if your sheets have 200 threads across their length and 200 threads across their width, the thread count would be 400. Many of us have been raised on the belief that the higher the thread count, the better the sheets, but in general, a quality sheet will have a thread count that’s between 200 and 800, with some going as high as 1,000.</p><p>The other important component of a quality sheet is fabric. Just like clothing, finding the right material for your bedding is vital to your comfort. Here are four of the most popular fabrics for sheets for winter that you should consider picking up this season.</p><ul><li><strong>Cotton</strong>: It’s pretty common to load up on layers in the winter, but if you’re someone who runs hot when you sleep, cotton just may be your best bet. As a natural fabric, cotton, like linen and bamboo, is known for its moisture-wicking abilities, making it a great pick for regulating your body temperature as you doze.</li><li><strong>Flannel</strong>: There’s a reason flannel is a cold-weather fashion staple, and that’s due to its warmth. So it would only make sense that <a href=#>sheets made from the same material</a> would be just as toasty! A wonderful semi-cross between cotton and fleece, flannel sheets are also soft, airy, and breathable, making them perfect for anyone who likes their bed warm, but not too warm.</li><li><strong>Silk</strong>: Silk might seem like a surprising choice for winter, but it shouldn’t be. Though commonly thought of as a luxurious-yet-thin fabric, it actually retains heats, making it an ideal material for snuggling up with on a cold winter’s eve.</li><li><strong>Fleece</strong>: As the warmest sheets out of the bunch, fleece is a no-brainer. This cross between a blanket and flannel offers extreme comfort and total warmth — even in sub-zero temperatures.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How often should you change your bedsheets?&nbsp;</h2><p>Now that you’ve figured out which sheet fabric is right for you, let’s talk about maintenance. One of the top bedding questions people have is how often their sheets should be changed. According to the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">National Sleep Foundation</a>, you should give your sheets a good wash at least once a week. As you sleep, things like dirt, sweat, and allergens can get caught up in bedding fibers, leading to a build up of bacteria.<br></p><p>If you’re a bi-weekly washer, however, you’re not alone: A <a rel=noopener aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=#>study b</a><a href=# rel=noopener aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">y</a><a rel=noopener aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=#> National Sleep Foundation</a> found that just 62 percent of people reported changing their bed sheets on a consistent basis every week, while 91 percent reported changing their sheets once every other week.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How long do bedsheets last?&nbsp;</h2><p>Another question that’s frequently posed about sheets is how long they will last. Much like blankets and duvet covers, the longevity of your bedding depends on how you wash and care for it. Wash sheets too often with water that’s too hot, and the fibers will become weak, eventually breaking down. To keep them in tip-top shape, wash them in warm water without chemical-laden fabric softeners.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Best Sheets for Winter</h2><p>Ready to upgrade your sleeping situation for the best sleep all winter long? Whether you’re looking for fleece or cotton sheets or a set that fits the budget, there’s an option out there for you. <strong>Keep scrolling for FIRST for Women’s picks for sheets for winter that will actually make you look forward to bedtime.</strong></p><h2 class=block-product__title><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow"><strong><strong><strong><strong>Urban Outfitters T-Shirt Jersey Set</strong></strong></strong></strong></a></h2><span class=block-product__eyebrow>Softest Sheets for Winter</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/best-sheets-for-winter.png><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy at Urban Outfitters</a>, $99</strong></p><h3 class=block-product-list__title>Why we like it:</h3><ul><li>Cotton jersey for a t-shirt feel</li><li><span style=font-size:1rem;text-indent:2rem>Four neutral colors</span></li><li><span style=font-size:1rem;text-indent:2rem>Machine wash</span></li></ul><p>It can be difficult to judge the “softest” winter bed sheets, since everyone’s idea of “soft” is different.
