It’s clear to see in the <a href=#>royals</a>‘ innermost secrets that were printed on paper he was smitten with the actress. At the time, back in 2017, <a href=#>Meghan was on the TV show Suits</a>, and Harry was trying to find his purpose in life. His brother <a href=#>Prince William</a> was married to Princess Kate and they had welcome two children into the world. But Haz – as the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star calls him – was feeling lost. That’s until they met, and <a href=#>Harry and Meghan’s star-studded royal wedding</a> followed.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1177213794-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-harry-invited-meghan-to-botswana>Harry invited Meghan to Botswana</h2><p>As he writes about how he found Meghan on <a href=#>Instagram</a> in a selfie posing with a mutual friend, the now 39-year-old describes he was infatuated with the <a href=#>celebrity</a>. He had to know who she was.</p><p>After getting the information from his friend Violet, they began DM’ing each other and texting. Then it was time for <a href=#>Harry and Meghan’s first date – where he invited her to his place</a> and she declined. Thankfully, it wasn’t the end before it even began. Instead, they went to a Soho restaurant, out of public view in a private room so they could enjoy it. He admits he had no idea how a Hollywood star as big as Meghan would be like in reality, and would the famous Markle be a diva?</p><p>He wasn’t sure.</p><p>But Harry also details how they then went on a second date the very next day. Meg was in London for a short spell so they didn’t want to waste any time. Although after, they had to spend the summer apart because of their busy schedules. Harry on one hand had a jam-packed rota for royal duties as well as a boys’ trip, while the actress was embracing an Eat, Pray, Love vacation across Europe with her friends.</p><p>So when it came that they both had the same week free in the middle, the two jumped at the chance to spend it together. Harry invited her to Botswana, a country close to his heart, and it’s actually where he got the diamonds from <a href=#>Meghan Markle’s engagement ring</a>.</p><p>The trip was a romantic dream, something out of a fairytale book that went on to cement their relationship as a <a href=#>celebrity couple</a>.</p><p>However, when the star arrived, the prince himself admits he stereotyped Meghan Markle as a Hollywood diva, and was quickly shut down after his thoughts.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-harry-thought-meghan-markle-was-a-hollywood-diva>Harry thought Meghan Markle was a ‘Hollywood diva’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-2011772838-1024x793.jpg><p>He writes she looked like “perfection” when she arrived in Botswana, despite an 11-hour trip to meet him.</p><p>Harry admits it was odd, <a href=#>despite texting</a> and FaceTiming several times since their second date. Perhaps it was the time between the face-to-face meeting.</p><p>He said: “We hugged, and it was awkward, not just because of the sandwich [he had given her] but the unavoidable suspense. We’d talked and FaceTimed countless times since our first dates, but this was all new and different.</p><p>“And a bit strange”.</p><p>But they shrugged it off and jumped into a truck for a ride to where they were staying.</p><p>When they arrived at a small camp on the edge of a big forest to spend the night, they were unpacking, and this is when Harry assumed Meghan Markle would reveal herself as a Hollywood diva with her bags.</p><p>He added: “She opened her small suitcase – she needed to get something.</p><p>“Here it comes, I thought. The mirror, the hairdryer, the makeup kit, the fluffy duvet, the dozen pairs of shoes”.</p><p>“I was shamefully stereotyping,” Harry pens in his memoir, believing the Hollywood star Meghan Markle was an “American actress [that] equals diva.”</p><p>“To my shock, and delight, there was nothing in that suitcase but bare essentials. Shorts, ripped jeans and snacks. And a yoga mat”.</p><p>Well, it seems the royal was over the moon he was proven wrong. As he later dropped down to one knee and proposed and the pair married in 2018. They welcomed <a href=#>Archie a year later before little Lilibet</a> in 2021.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2eAcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2GaqrZ2imry1xc%2Bem2allZy1orqMppiro5yaerW0yKeioqaXYsCpsYywmKxlkWK1sLjLsq6op5RisarCwGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
