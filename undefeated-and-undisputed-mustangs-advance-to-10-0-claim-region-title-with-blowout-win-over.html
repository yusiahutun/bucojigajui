If every point scored against the unit in its previous nine contests were tacked on to the Tigers’ total on Thursday, West Jones would still have won, 37-36.</span></p><p><span>It was the offense, however, that kickstarted the momentum in the regular-season finale. After receiving the opening kickoff, freshman quarterback “Tootie” Lindsey and the Mustangs marched 66 yards in only four plays for the first score of the night. Lindsey reached the 2-yard line on a 40-yard quarterback-keeper, and senior Rase Jones bullied his way into the end zone to give West Jones a 7-0 lead.</span></p><p><span>Lindsey’s legs prevailed moments later after a three-and-out for West Jones’ defense, scoring on a 63-yard scramble to put the Mustangs ahead 13-0 after a missed point-after attempt.</span></p><p><span>Feeding off the offense’s momentum and sheer skill, the Mustangs’ defense forced another three-and-out, and a blocked punt gave West Jones possession at the Hattiesburg 17-yard line. Four plays later, senior Joseph Hernandez made up for the missed PAT with a 30-yard field goal to put the Mustangs ahead&nbsp;</span>16-0 midway through the first quarter.</p><p><span>A third straight three-and-out forced the Tigers to punt less than two minutes later, and a third Mustang — sophomore running back Caleb Holmes — strutted into the end zone only two plays later on a run of roughly 50 yards to break what little spirit remained along the home sideline.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>West Jones head coach Cory Reynolds said he was proud of the offense’s strong start, showing clear progress from previous contests, but far more than three were responsible for making it happen.</span></p><p><span>“Going down on that first drive and sticking it in the end zone — that was huge for us,” Reynolds said. “That’s what we want to do every game, just come out and give the defense a 7-0 lead. The last couple weeks, we’ve started fast, and, boy, that just really fires the defense up.</span></p><p><span>“We’ve got a really, really good offensive line coach in David Parker. He has those guys prepared every week, and they’re the heart and soul of our offense. Hattiesburg has a really good team, but we just leaned on those guys and the running game.”</span></p><p><span>On the ensuing drive, Hattiesburg accomplished something that hadn’t been achieved against the Mustangs since Sept. 15. Junior quarterback Tony Vance Jr. scored on a quarterback sneak that West Jones coaches and players vehemently argued never crossed the goal line, but the officials disagreed. Despite giving up the score, Reynolds said the effort and sense of urgency his defense showed despite still having the lead was a testament to what has made them the most successful unit in MHSAA football this season.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“It’s the sense of pride they have,” Reynolds said. “And that starts with what Coach Hicks, Coach Thompson and Coach Easterling instill in them every day when we go over film and the senior leadership we have on that side of the ball.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“It’s important to them. Our first response as coaches was to say, ‘That’s alright, just don’t let them score again,’ and they didn’t. Our offensive line was moving folks all night, but our defense is going to win us a bunch of games.”</span></p><p><span>The last of Hattiesburg’s hope was squashed early in the fourth quarter with a bruising 3-yard touchdown run by junior running back Elijah Jones. Still locked in as the visiting crowd celebrated the 30-7 lead, Jones returned to the sideline with a grim look on his face, noting that the Tigers “stole my towel” during his 12th touchdown run of the season.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The Mustangs tacked on one final score with under four minutes remaining, with one last round of bully ball from Rase Jones and his lead blocker, standout defensive tackle Jonathan Keys. The Tigers knew exactly what was coming whenever the Mustangs lined up in a Wildcat formation, but they couldn’t stop it, as Jones powered his way into the end zone from 2 yards out for his second touchdown in the 37-7 win.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The win sealed West Jones’ region title and erased any doubt as to who should represent the region as the No. 1 seed in the playoffs. The Mustangs will kick off postseason play at home on Friday with a first-round contest against the Hancock Hawks (8-3, 2-3 in Region 4-6A).</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaK2embKnscCtnJ1lkaOxbsHNnaCsqKWpsqV5zK6qrZmenMBurcOvmKeblWLBsHmQaWRpZZOhrqq5jKucoKGfo3q1tdOlnGavmam1bq7LqK6oraRixKq6jKitnqpflr%2B1tcKlnJiZk5uzdX3DbWRwmWhnenJ9xJ5kcZyVZnqjf8RwnZppZ259dq%2BNoaumpA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
