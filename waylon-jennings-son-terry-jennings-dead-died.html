Terry Jennings died in the early morning hours on Friday (Jan. 25), only four days after he turned 62.</p><p>Jennings' son, Josh, turned to <a href=#>Facebook</a> to share the news, writing, "... with a heavy heart I am here to inform you all that my father passed earlier this morning. He lived an [adventurous] life as many of you know and he has accomplished so much. I was always proud to be his son. I know he touched many of your hearts and he always enjoyed sharing his life adventures and lessons with you all. I still hold many of those lessons with me everyday."</p><p>"This is a hard time for all of us, and I ask that you give the family and I some peace as we are dealing with this great loss," he finishes.</p><p>Terry Jennings was the oldest of four children born of Waylon's first marriage to Maxine Caroll Lawrence, whom he married in 1956 at the age of 18. In a 2017 book titled <a href=#>Waylon, Tales of My Outlaw Dad</a>, he recounted his close relationship with his iconic father. He traveled on tour with Waylon Jennings selling merchandise initially, then became a technician and stage manager for drummer Richie Albright before serving as Waylon's production manager.</p><p>According to his <a href=#>biography</a>, Jennings went on to a career that included working for booking agencies, publishing companies and as a talent scout for major record labels. He later founded Korban Music Group LLC, a full-service management, consulting and publishing company.</p><p>Terry's brother Shooter, who portrayed their father in the <a href=#>Johnny Cash</a> biopic Walk the Line, also turned to social media to remember his older brother.</p><p>"So sad to see ya go, Terry. I love you," he writes on <a href=#>Instagram</a>, telling his fans, "My brother Terry turned me onto <a href=#>Alice Cooper</a>, the <a href=#>Moody Blues</a>, <a href=#>Cream</a>, <a href=#>Zeppelin</a> and more. He was that older brother who had the killer record collection and the wild streak. Having one for him today. I listened to Love It&nbsp;to Death last night as I was going to sleep in Terry’s honor. Sad day."</p><p><strong>13 Country Stars Who Died Too Young:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmsJmpobyvecmepaehnpzAbr%2FOp2StnaKnxm62xKeloqaXqHqlscCdZJ2hlZl8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
