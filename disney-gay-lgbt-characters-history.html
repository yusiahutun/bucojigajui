"LeFou is somebody who on one day wants to be Gaston and on another day wants to kiss Gaston," Condon said. "He's confused about what he wants."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Following that announcement, evangelical preacher Franklin Graham <a data-external=true href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://time.com/4691035/franklin-graham-beauty-and-the-beast-gay-character/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=warned class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">warned</a> that Disney is trying to "push the LGBT agenda into the hearts and minds of… children."

Although Disney is marketing Beauty and the Beast as a major step forward for the studio, Le Fou's blossoming sexuality only receives but passing acknowledgment—a blink-and-you'll-miss-it aside that's more of an Easter Egg for LGBT viewers than a full-on coming out. But in truth, the Mouse House has a long and complicated relationship with queer representation. Le Fou might be the first character that Disney has openly recognized as being gay, but that doesn't mean LGBT people haven't been there all along.</p><img alt="Terrestrial animal, Art, Clip art, Snout, Animation, Illustration, Graphics, Tail, Drawing, Animal figure, " title="Terrestrial animal, Art, Clip art, Snout, Animation, Illustration, Graphics, Tail, Drawing, Animal figure, " width=1500 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/12/1490040394-disney01.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Disney</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Sean Griffin literally wrote the book on the gay history of Disney.

"All the other bulls wanted most of all to fight at the bullfights in Madrid, but not Ferdinand," the narrator explains. "He still liked to sit just quietly under the cork tree and smell the flowers." Ferdinand is eventually captured and forced to make his debut in the ring, but he refuses to fight. When the bull sees the bouquet of daisies the bullfighter is carrying, he becomes too enraptured with their scent to do battle.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The bull is drawn with long eyelashes and lots of effeminate characteristics, but the cartoon doesn't really judge him as being scary," Griffin says.

While "gay" refers to people who like members of their same sex, "queer" is a reclaimed term that <a data-external=true href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://books.google.ca/books?id=gia9BgAAQBAJ&pg=PT218&lpg=PT218&dq=%22queer%22+is+a+reclaimed+term++academic+circles+in+the+early+1990&source=bl&ots=6AL2vSb5JQ&sig=oVYVU4u-AxobX1RuL9uZzZl8CgU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiUkPW97OfSAhUJ7mMKHZsBAd0Q6AEIKTAD#v=onepage&q=%22queer%22%20is%20a%20reclaimed%20term%20%20academic%20circles%20in%20the%20early%201990&f=false" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="sprang up" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">sprang up</a> in academic circles in the early 1990s. The word is used both as an umbrella term for the LGBT community and embodies a notion of difference. To be "queer" means to stand in for the Other, whether that's in terms of your sexual orientation or a performance of gender outside the norm. It can be hard to define, but you know queerness when you see it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Reluctant Dragon, a <a data-external=true href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IijeNu3ixo" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=short class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">short</a> produced in 1941, is extremely queer, even if it's not necessarily gay. A sassy dragon will only agree to joust if he and the knight "fix" the contest: The men rush into a cave where they clang pots and pans to pretend they're fighting to the death while, in reality, they're just drinking tea. When the two emerge from their hiding place, they begin to charge at one another and—following their collision—are enveloped in a giant mushroom cloud of smoke. Behind the smoke screen, the supposed foes are not trying to kill each other; they're dancing a tender waltz as the dragon pretends to scream for help.</p><img alt="Art, Teal, Cartoon, Painting, Illustration, Artwork, Drawing, Graphics, Clip art, Animation, " title="Art, Teal, Cartoon, Painting, Illustration, Artwork, Drawing, Graphics, Clip art, Animation, " width=1500 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/12/1490040438-disney04.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Disney</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The studio's early positive representations of queerness fell by the wayside following increasing scrutiny under the <a data-external=true href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1026152?mag=the-glamorous-tradition-of-hollywood-lifestyle-advice" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Motion Picture Production Code." class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Motion Picture Production Code.</a> More popularly known as the Hays Code, it <a data-external=true href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.und.edu/instruct/cjacobs/ProductionCode.htm data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=prohibited class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">prohibited</a> "sex perversion or any inference."

The backlash to Le Fou's sexuality might suggest that the studio has finally caught up to the times by portraying an out-and-proud gay man on screen, but the decision is as progressive as it is cautious.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=55 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the original film, Le Fou isn't gay. He's the secondary villain—the squat, oafish sidekick to Gaston's uber-masculine hunk, one who lives vicariously through his best friend's sexual exploits. But the 2017 Beauty and the Beast remixes this character. Le Fou, dressed in a Captain Hook shade of hot pink, clearly has a torch burning for Gaston (played in the film by <a data-external=true href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://time.com/3491050/luke-evans-dracula-untold-coming-out/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="gay actor Luke Evans" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">gay actor Luke Evans</a>).

While coming to terms with his own sexuality, Le Fou also begins to realize that his friend may not be as great as he seems. During the climactic battle in which the villagers storm the castle, Le Fou becomes pinned to the ground, and despite his cries for help, Gaston doesn't come to his aid. In this moment, Le Fou decides to switch sides: instead of fighting with the townspeople to destroy the Beast, he joins the castle's inhabitants to save Beast's life.</p><img alt="Gesture, Hand, Stock photography, Smile, Photography, Finger, Thumb, Happy, Illustration, " title="Gesture, Hand, Stock photography, Smile, Photography, Finger, Thumb, Happy, Illustration, " width=1500 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/12/1490040721-disney02.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Disney</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=61 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Le Fou finally gets his "big moment" at the end, but it may not satisfy either LGBT audiences hoping the studio would exorcise its anti-gay demons or critics worried Disney is pushing a <a data-external=true href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/frozen-creator-responds-gay-agenda-claims-221400764.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action='"gay agenda."' class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">"gay agenda."</a> During the battle, three of the townspeople are accosted by Madame de Garderobe, the enchanted wardrobe <a data-external=true href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.playbill.com/article/audra-mcdonald-goes-for-the-high-note-in-this-beauty-and-the-beast-clip data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=voiced class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">voiced</a> by Audra McDonald; she forces them to wear dresses and ladies' wigs.

Griffin says that in 1937, a group of lesbians in Chicago threw a series of bashes known as "Mickey Mouse's parties." These gatherings for like-minded ladies were a reference to the fact that "Mickey Mouse" was a common term at the time for gay men.
