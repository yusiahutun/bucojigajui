When it finds that there isn't, it will let you know and give you the option to create one.

Write it down if you need to, but you can always view or change the password later if you forget it.

You won't need to know the old password to make this change. Windows assumes that if you have access to the PC, you can make the change. You also won't need to do anything to PCs that are already joined to the HomeGroup. They will stay joined and if you view the password on those PCs, you'll see the new password you set.</p><h2 id=how-to-join-an-existing-homegroup>How to Join an Existing HomeGroup</h2><p>If there's already a HomeGroup on your network, or if you just created one, joining it from a new PC follows much the same process as creating a new HomeGroup.
