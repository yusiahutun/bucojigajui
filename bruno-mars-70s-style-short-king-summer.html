The same could be said for his over-the-top commitment to outfits inspired by previous eras. An artist in every sense, it seems like the 15-time Grammy-winning singer and musician can't help but match his aesthetic to his music.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As the pop star confirmed to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vogue</a>, he has a similar creative process when it comes to music and fashion. "When I'm writing a song, it's about the emotion: What do I want people to feel?" he told the outlet. "I approach clothing that same way: How do I want to feel when I put on that jacket?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you trace his style evolution all the way back to the star's Doo-Wops and Hooligans era, '60s-inspired suits and faded hair were his signatures. When his "Finesse" single on 24K Magic dropped, it was clear Mars was channeling the '90s in both sound and aesthetic (see: that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>iconic performance</a> with Cardi B). Next, "Versace on the Floor" and Bruno's patterned silk sets, courtesy of Donatella, of course, marked a clear '80s tribute. And now, Bruno's wardrobe of wide collars, leisure suits, and funky patterns make it evident that he's in his '70s era — as if his Silk Sonic supergroup with longtime collaborator Anderson Paak and recent discography didn't make that obvious.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Regardless of the decade he's emulating, Mars's fashion sense and stage presence make him larger-than-life — and sure, Google confirms that the living music legend is somewhere around 5'5" height-wise. But, his chest hair-baring button-downs, flared pants, and perfectly coiffed curls are all a tribute to the newest iteration of Hot Girl Summer: Short-King Summer. Scroll through for the original Short King's best '70s-influenced 'fits.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In June, Mars attended the 2022 BET Awards wearing orange-and-navy plaid trousers paired with a matching blazer and an unbuttoned shirt with an exaggerated collar. He accessorized with a beige fedora, white boots, and large aviator sunglasses. The most '70s part of it all? The thin, sliver of a mustache.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2021, Bruno launched a clothing line with Lacoste, and the singer told Vogue at the time that big collars were one of his favorite trends. "There's something magnificent and powerful about a collar being big," he said "It gives confidence to whomever's wearing it; it feels like a cape."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the 2022 Grammy Awards, Mars took the stage with his bandmate Paak in a white bedazzled suit that conjures up memories of Elvis's iconic last performance in 1977. Bruno used to do a wicked <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Elvis impersonation</a> — at just 4 years old, he performed in his family's band in Hawaii.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Silk Sonic is undeniably influenced by the '70s — the band's song "Skate" is literally a tribute to retro roller rinks. The two performed for the very first time as a unit at the 2021 Grammys in matching rust-colored suits with taupe button-downs and massive aviator shades. Gold chains are obviously a must, and Mars finished off the look with a matching gold wristwatch.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another patterned suit, undone shirt, aviator sunnies — with a cigarette and tiny 'stache to boot. This whole look is screaming John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Bruno Mars/Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">An unbuttoned <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Hawaiian shirt</a> and flared pants are practically the poster child(ren) of the decade. Bruno put a 2022 twist on the throwback look with white boots and a woven bucket hat. There's something about an open collar on a Short King that just works.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8GrrKenXaKus7%2BMcGesZaOpxq2xjKyfqKqkYriqusZmqq6lnZq%2F</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
