"Nothing too contrived." To complement that, <a class=hm-link href=#>make-up artist</a> <strong>Karan Mitchell</strong> chose a "romantic palette", while the star's friend and stylist Nicole Chavez added sparkle with <strong>Neil Lane</strong> diamond earrings. "It was a labour of love," Nicole said of Jessica's wedding day look. Meanwhile, more details have emerged about the star-studded wedding, which took place at the San Ysidro Ranch in California in front of more than 250 guests, including <a class=hm-link href=#>Jessica Alba</a>&nbsp;and her husband&nbsp;<strong>Cash Warren</strong>, plus sister&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Ashlee Simpson</a> and her fiancé <strong>Evan Ross</strong>.

Jessica reportedly said her own name rather than Eric's, but laughed it off before trying again. Insiders also told that Jessica didn't dance much during the reception, preferring instead to spend time talking to her guests. It didn't stop the party continuing well into the early hours though, with some invitees staying on until 5am. "<strong>You better believe it was 'Wow’'</strong>," one guest said of the wedding, which followed an 80-month-long engagement. "That freakin’ thing must have cost a million bucks.
