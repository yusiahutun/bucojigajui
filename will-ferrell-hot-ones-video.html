"Jerry's actually driving and he's got the tiniest little cameras," Ferrell confirmed. "He's actually driving the car and I will have to say he's an excellent driver. He just tries to pick a car he feels is suited to your personality or reflects you in some way."</p></li></ul><ul readability=1><li></li><li readability=5><p>The actor revealed why he quit Twitter after just four days on the social networking site. "I was tweeting about something, promoting some charity event I was gonna do and people were like, 'That's not what Twitter is for, STOP!" he explained, "I got shouted off Twitter."</p></li></ul><ul readability=1><li></li><li readability=5><p>The funniest athlete he worked with on "Saturday Night Live" was "definitely Shaquille O'Neal," he revealed. "We did a sketch, you can find it online, it was cut for time but we did a sketch where ... I was in footie pajamas and the cast was picking on me and Shaq came over and shooed em all away and proceeded to sing a song called 'No One Hurts My Little Man.' It was very bizarre."</p></li></ul><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:61525dbf-d436-5612-9b92-210d560f7ab8 data-container-ref=toofab:article:8b24b661-d508-5852-8cb8-3b0de0fd5a05 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ad/5by4/2020/01/24/adb8338fe1835a1388a0b17e87fa61c8_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Warner Bros.</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jennifer Aniston Guest Hosts (and Roasts) Ellen, Answers Burning Questions with Will Ferrell</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><ul readability=2><li readability=7><p>Bringing up how Ferrell has eaten both maple syrup spaghetti for "Elf" and a reindeer eyeball while on Bear Grylls' "Man vs. Grylls," Evans asked which was worse. "The eyeball was slimy and gelatinous and then you crunched down on the cornea," he replied without hesitating. "There's no question. Little maple syrup on spaghetti, who cares? Reindeer eyeball, 20 miles north of the Arctic circle, not good."</p></li></ul><ul readability=-0.5><li></li><li readability=2><p>Ferrell still has his prosthetic testicles from "Step Brothers" and considers them his most prized possessions. "I keep them in a little trophy case," he said, "like you'd put a signed baseball."</p></li></ul><ul readability=1><li></li><li readability=5><p>While filming "Old School," Will got naked in front of Snoop Dogg. While there were stories out there that he needed "liquid courage" for the scene, he told Evans that wasn't the case. "I actually didn't. But in between takes it took so long to get Snoop Dogg out of his trailer as he was smoking and playing video games that out of boredom I just started drinking," he said.</p></li></ul><ul readability=1.5><li></li><li readability=6><p>"Anchorman" almost had a completely different storyline. This is something Ferrell's talked about in the past, but always interesting to anyone who maybe hasn't heard it already. "It was going to be a movie about newsmen, meets the movie 'Alive' where they have to survive in the mountains," he explained. "It was all about trying to survive and get down the mountain while being stalked by chimpanzees with Chinese throwing stars. Needless to say, Hollywood said no."</p></li></ul><p>The video ended with him telling his "Downhill" costar Julia Louis Dreyfus -- who bailed on Hot Ones because she was feeling under the weather -- "you're so happy you're not doing this."</p><p>"Downhill" is out now.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:23b53950-f569-55bf-820e-5dc4024e9c12 data-container-ref=toofab:article:8b24b661-d508-5852-8cb8-3b0de0fd5a05 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/4f/5by4/2019/11/24/4f775911be985c089d622806f018ca67_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">NBC</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Will Ferrell SNL Sketches Ranked: Guest-Star Bonanaza Highlights Brilliantly Hilarious Thanksgiving Outing</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3F7j2tma2hfrLatuIyfnKuqlaG5brTOrWSoppWoere1w56maA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
