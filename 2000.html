Ironically, news of his final illness brought about a career resurgence. He travelled with Robbie Williams into the Sri Lankan war zone to highlight efforts to vaccinate children against polio. He also continued to performed at concerts, including Paul Weller's annual outdoor London festival in August 1998, and appeared in a number of television advertisements.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Attached to a drip, he made the most of his final months, speaking bravely and matter-of-factly about facing death. He sought to remove the taboos about the disease that had already taken some of his closest friends. He had managed to conceal his cancer for three years, but went public in a Sunday paper interview when it spread to his liver and became inoperable. Forever counting his reasons to be cheerful, he said: "You don't have cancer; it has you. The 'chemo' [chemotherapy] won't get rid of it. But it's another lease of - well, however long it is. You just don't know, but it's better than being hit by a bus tomorrow; you have time to sort yourself out."</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>He had reservations about using private medicine "because I'm a socialist, but I don't want to go on no waiting list and end up a dead socialist".</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>He leaves two grown up children from his first marriage to Elizabeth, which ended in divorce in 1985, and two young children from his second marriage, to sculptress Sophie Tilson.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaK2bZH9xfI9opJqqX2eEcII%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
