Jan has rather unusual roots in East Africa, where she lived as the child of missionary parents. Living in Ethiopia in the 1960s and 70s, she had few resources, so she learned to re-stitch clothes with a running machine. At the age of eleven, Jan made boxer shorts, cut from a pillowcase, for an Ethiopian deaf man.</p><p>She attended several schools, including one in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, before enrolling at Baptist Bible College. Although it has not yet been confirmed, it is possible that Jan Rousseaux studied in Germany and may also have graduated from Missouri State University.</p><p><b>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Who Is Turk Lesnar? The Untold Truth Of Brock Lesnar’s Son</a></b></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Jan Rousseaux started her career <a href=# rel=noopener>designing</a> for Leather Gallery in Miamisburg, Ohio, which catered to the western and motorcycle industries for offshore production. In 1995, she set up her store, House Of Rousseaux, in Springfield, Missouri. Two years later, she set up her own company, Jan Rousseax LLC, in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p><p>From the mid to late 2000s, Jan was designing and selling for Silver State Industries. She then became President of YellowKat Marketing, a hospitality image apparel, and uniform consultancy, in 2011. She has also sketched gift boots for Petite Follies.</p><p>In addition, in December 2015, Rousseau designed and created a storefront sign in downtown Moab for her husband John Ramsey’s company, Redtail Air.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-inspired-jan-rousseaux-to-become-a-designer><strong>What Inspired Jan Rousseaux To Become A Designer?</strong></h2><p>At the age of eighteen, Rousseaux moved to Springfield, Missouri. There, she began to hone her skills – learning how to construct clothing. Eventually, she got a job designing and making outfits for celebrities, entertainers, and anyone who took center stage in the nearby city of Branson.</p><p>Over the next fifteen years, Branson became the country music capital of the USA, and millions of people began to visit the area each year.</p><p>The new uniform supplier initially worked with most of the shows that were shown on the runway. Later, she started designing and creating exaggerated wardrobe outfits for celebrities known all over the country – especially for red carpets and the like.</p><p>Rousseau traveled from New York to Los Angeles and Hong Kong in search of unique fabrics to bring her sketches to life. One of Jan’s designs is exhibited at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-rousseaux-became-a-hospitality-designer><strong>How Rousseaux Became A Hospitality Designer?</strong></h2><p>Ramsey moved to Las Vegas in 2004. One day, while having <a href=# rel=noopener>breakfast</a> at a diner, she noticed that the servers were wearing very ugly uniforms that didn’t match the mood of the place. So Jan went to the drawing board and drew an apron line that suited the character of the small restaurant. And so began her interest in design for the hospitality industry.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=jan-rousseaux-married-the-late-jon-benets-father-john-ramsey><strong>Jan Rousseaux Married The Late JonBenet’s Father, John Ramsey</strong></h2><p>Designer Jan <a href=# rel=noopener>married</a> John Ramsey on 21 July 2011 in Charlevoix, Michigan. The wedding ceremony took place at Castle Farms in Charlevoix, with 70 guests in attendance, including the other adult Ramsey children. This was the same town where John’s late daughter, JonBenet, had been crowned Little Miss Charlevoix in 1994.</p><p>Rousseau had allegedly met her husband John at a friend’s wedding in Denver two years earlier.</p><p>“She was cute and lively and she told me she liked&nbsp;The Office.&nbsp;That was great. I love&nbsp;The Office,“</p><p>John told People magazine about Rousseaux in 2012. Both Rousseau and Ramsey are very religious. Together they also own an advertising marketing company in Las Vegas.</p><p>The current husband of a hospitality clothing designer has twice unsuccessfully run for public office in Charlevoix.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=beginning-of-jan-rousseaux-husband-john-ramseys-relationship><strong>Beginning Of Jan Rousseaux&nbsp;</strong><strong>& Husband&nbsp;</strong><strong>John Ramsey’s Relationship</strong></h2><p>Gianna once said that it was only in June 2009 that she texted Mr. Ramsey that she was thinking of him, and after that, their relationship blossomed.</p><p>The designer said that John then immediately asked if he could come to her just as a friend. The two then entered into a long-distance relationship.</p><p>She revealed that John used to drive seven hours from Moab, Utah, to Las Vegas to see her every weekend afterward. The clothing expert revealed that her husband never complained, and this effort got her attention.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=she-got-engaged-on-valentines-day><strong>She Got Engaged On Valentine’s Day</strong></h2><p>The father of the deceased proposed to Jan Rousseaux on Valentine’s Day 2010 at a resort in Vero Beach, Florida.</p><p>John said he proposed during breakfast. Ramsey allegedly told her that he had something for her and then gave her a diamond ring.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=both-of-jan-rousseaux-and-john-ramsey-had-married-in-the-past><strong>Both Of Jan Rousseaux And John Ramsey Had Married In The Past</strong></h2><p>She was married twice before John Ramsey and has several grown-up children of her own.</p><p>Ramsey’s wedding to Jan also took place five years after his beloved wife Patty died of ovarian cancer in 2006 at the age of 49. Patsy was the second wife to whom John had walked down the aisle.</p><p>Ramsey had four children from his first and second marriages. He lost one daughter in a car accident just five years before the death of his second daughter, JonBenet. However, both of his sons, John Andrew Ramsey and Burke Ramsey, are still alive.</p><p>After the death of his second wife Patsy, John briefly met Beth Twitty, mother of Natalie Holloway, who disappeared in Aruba in 2005. They later broke up, with Rust’s husband justifying it by saying that “Beth was behind me in terms of the mourning cycle”.</p><p><b>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Sultana Abdul-Jabbar: Everything About Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s Daughter</a></b></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=jan-rousseaux-had-gone-bankrupt-with-her-former-husband><strong>Jan Rousseaux Had Gone Bankrupt With Her Former Husband</strong></h2><p>Five years before her wedding to John Ramsey, Rousseaux had fallen on hard financial times. According to her bankruptcy petition filed in 2005, <a href=# rel=noopener>she had debts</a> of only 100 US dollars and 230 000 US dollars.</p><p>What’s more, in an earlier bankruptcy filing in 2003, she and then-husband Bobby Joe May claimed they had only USD 38 in the bank.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=net-worth><strong>Net Worth</strong></h2><p>For someone like Rousseaux, who has been in the fashion industry since childhood, it is only to be expected that she has had ups and downs in many aspects; be it finances or her career itself. As has already been discussed, it has not been all glitz and glamour for the now 63-year-old designer, who has experienced bankruptcy and a few setbacks.</p><p>Nevertheless, for Rousseau, all of her businesses are doing well and she seems to have a strong reputation as a venerable fashion entrepreneur. However, little has been said about her net worth or financial status. However, given her long career, she could be worth millions of dollars, even if she is not a wealthy businesswoman.</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><td>Name</td><td>Jan Rousseaux</td></tr><tr><td>Birthplace</td><td>East Africa</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Ethnicity</td><td>East African</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Blonde</td></tr><tr><td>Eyes Color</td><td>Blue</td></tr><tr><td>Husband</td><td>John Bennett Ramsey</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Who is Jan Rousseaux, and what is her connection to John Ramsey?</strong></h3><p>Jan Rousseaux is the wife of John Ramsey, known for being the father of JonBenet Ramsey, a young girl whose murder remains unsolved.
