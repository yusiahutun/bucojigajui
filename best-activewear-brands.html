To start, high-caliber activewear needs to be functional. Think lightweight, sweat-wicking, and free of chafing, bunching, or riding. "When thinking about what’s important in quality athletic wear fabric durability is key,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Alejandra Hernandez</a>, Lead Designer of Year of Ours — an ultra-trendy, female-led lifestyle brand that made this roundup — tells InStyle. “You want to know that your leggings are going to survive lots of washes, that the fabric won’t stretch out over time, and that the inner thighs won’t pill.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It also, of course, has to be cute. That’s why investing in good sportswear is twofold. You want to look good, but you also want to feel good while you’re moving around (Moving around, that is, from boxing class to brunch, from the street to the court, or onto a treadmill when you rather be doing anything but cardio). So, with that in mind, our team was up for the challenge to find the most flattering and functional activewear options to ensure that you arrive at your next workout or boutique fitness class in style.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-girlfriend-collective></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Girlfriend Collective</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1256 data-sizes=750px alt="girlfriend collective sports bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/xKRXfZJaTtp3yUbpyXiuJ_P9i0Y=/fit-in/1500x1256/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GirlfriendCollective_TommyBra-3195b5f9c56445229e378b9126323c0e.jpg"><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are so many reasons to love this eco-friendly activewear brand from promoting size-inclusivity and slow fashion to the consistent, ultra-soft fabrics (I’m wearing the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Tommy Bra</a> as I write). And while I might be lounging around in my GF set, this same activewear crop top-bike short combo holds up even after the sweatiest of workouts. Not to mention, the sizing and fits are superior. The brand carries up to 6X with real bodies in mind, and chances are you won’t have to exchange if you buy online because the garments are true to size.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">They’re also ethically made from post-consumer water bottles and fabric scraps — but it’s not like you would notice.

The leggings, namely the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Align</a> style, have gained a massive following, and it’s understandable why. The brand-exclusive Nulu fabric is silky soft,&nbsp; breathable, and lightweight, while the other workout gear fabrics prove as impressive — and hold up after many wears.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The brand is fitness buff- and celeb-approved, sported by notable names from Hilary Duff to Meghan Markle for a variety of sweat-intensive activities. If you’re looking for anything from reflective bike shorts and water-repellent tech fleece jackets to sturdy yoga mats and insulated water storage, Lululemon has your workout needs covered.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-alo-yoga></span> <img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Alo Yoga 7/8 HIGH-WAIST AIRLIFT LEGGING " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/opfm3lBzlpcG6RW6NN3nsIenRH0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Alo-Yoga-7-8-HIGH-WAIST-AIRLIFT-LEGGING--fa8984119ea94545a71fdffb931693d3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Alo Yoga</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Alo Yoga is a wellness-focused brand that is contemporary and cool. Celebrities like Taylor Swift and Hailey Bieber endorse the Southern California-based label, likely because the pieces offer an effortless model-off-duty vibe. The leggings move with the body and don’t roll during your sweat sesh, which translates well into any workout space. And for yoga, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Airlift Leggings</a> are a must-have.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bandier></span> <img width=1500 height=899 data-sizes=750px alt=Bandier style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/divyK53pnoFV81udPz00KZieolU=/fit-in/1500x899/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/DESKTOP_2-UP_white-edit_660x4962x-52e7890c85234b5495241252baa7334a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bandier</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Okay, we know Bandier is technically not a brand itself, but the multi-brand retailer stocks fashionable fitness wear from companies, like Stella McCartney, Nike, and New Balance, along with other trendy and on-the-rise brands. It also offers exclusive and limited-edition workout essentials. But beyond the big trademarks, it offers stellar sports bras, ultra-comfy leggings, and impeccably crafted workout gear in the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">All Access</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Le Ore</a> lines. So, if you’re in the pursuit of finding the intersection where high style and high performance meet, Bandier is your place.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-athleta></span> <img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Athleta Advantage Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Xn9_muhG7T5ELJMO9M9gRLU5fus=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/advantage-jacket-5f740193bc244b6493df43e38946546b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Athleta</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A staple that's proved indispensable is a good workout legging — and that’s what Athleta does best. The makers have mastered leggings that molds to the body, don’t roll or dig into the hips, and hold up after multiple wears. They’re buttery soft and cozy enough to wear while lounging around, whether it’s flare, straight-leg, or split-hem. There's also an endless selections of seamless tops, athletic dresses, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>skorts</a>, and size-inclusive sports bras to choose from for your next warm-up to cool-down.&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-tory-sport></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tory Sport</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Tory Burch Activewear" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/OomnI9zaEUTvvdAHfSuf1-3dZlg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/147-420c0c053fc4459e87c041accb94a8c3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Tory Sport</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This 1970s-inspired sportswear line by Tory Burch captures the elegance of sport — in the best way. This brand is composed of beautiful, well-appointed pieces; Each garment is as functional as it is fabulous, our latest favorites being the printed leggings and golf pants, simple polos, and polished pleated <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">tennis skirts</a>. From fabric to fit, this posh playwear checks all our boxes, and we guess that it has something for everyone’s exercise needs.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-splits59></span> <img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=SPLITS59 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/QC59XpZ80mhfJyBVHETmPARrZSA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/148-180d9642988a4287a026cc04ae6d2e4f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>SPLITS59</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Splits59 doles out a healthy does of Y2K style with a variety of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">flared leggings</a>, old-school-inspired rugby tops, and asymmetric sports bras.

With unofficial endorsements from <a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bella Hadid</a> and Devon Lee Carlson, the brand's classic offerings, such as the Forum Sneaker and that exact zip-up, lead the vintage appeal. The brand's street cred has only been bolstered by noteworthy collaborations with Gucci, Stella McCartney, and Yeezy, giving a fresh twist to the Adidas we all know and love. It's remained relevant for decades, but its increasingly robust product line now includes everything from comfy yoga-centric leggings to cropped T-shirts and bodysuits.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-year-of-ours></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Year of Ours</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Year of Ours" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7r2eDrTj2No4-43jYZAAK_2r63w=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/150-8940ae4ba9314930a53198d2fb159ccc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Year of Ours</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Year of Ours is a female-led activewear label that makes well-made workout attire that’s bound to be coveted. The Los Angeles-based lifestyle offers eye-catching silhouettes with edgy details, such as ribbed leggings with intricate lacing, sweat-wicking leggings with a dose of 1980s-inspired hues, and sports bras with neutral color-blocking and cutouts. We only wish the sizing, which ranges from XS to 2X, was more inclusive.&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-nike></span> <img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=Nike style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/KbDXvr26MwMABGUtmN1X2IftGBk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/151-87729abb4f30418b95a74c9b274e1c54.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nike</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As one of the world’s premier sportswear brands, Nike is an all-encompassing, no-frills option. It’s the type of brand that you know is going to hold up throughout your longest distances, with no concern about going an extra mile: Whatever your sport-centered need, Nike will bestow. And while it remains one of the sector’s biggest leaders, it still remains fresh, revamping classic, reliable models or teaming up with notable designers like Jacquemus, a collaborative line that intersects high fashion with street style undeniably well. The sport-centric also has a longstanding celebrity following, from Serena Williams to Billie Eilish.&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-outdoor-voices></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Outdoor Voices</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="The Exercise Dress" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/OFke2Vqc4nZkr2CBQ1VN64mxejg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/the-exercise-dress-15a0a178e2d54c33be4987d9c44d6891.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Outdoor Voices is a lifestyle wear brand that frees performance and focuses on the recreationist. “Our products are engineered for performance and designed for having fun,” says Gabrielle Conforti, CEO of the high-performing activewear. “We focus on creating pieces that move with you, no matter the activity.” For that reason, OV is a solid option; The approachable sportswear can go from being a midday-errand-run uniform to becoming an ideal get-up for even the sweatiest of workouts. There are tons of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>lounge-friendly options</a>, like the flouncy <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">exercise dress</a>, and compressive fabrics, which are engineered to remain sturdy during a high-intensity workout, while still remaining breathable and flexible, like a second skin.&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-fp-movement></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>FP Movement</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="FP Movement" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/dvI45HSJ50sBSZA4tApkBhl6zbw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/FP-Movement-76172d7b07fc45faa9e6d817e57fbe0a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Free People</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s a likelihood you’ve heard of Free People’s athletic line, not only for the super-cute running and yoga-friendly bottoms, but for other staples you'd never thought you'd need, such as packable puffer jackets, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">workout jumpsuits, and even unitards</a>. The Free People offshoot is a one-stop shop for everything from hiking and camping gear to surf suits, providing essentials for countless activities. And whether you’re hitting the dance studio or the ski slopes, this label still provides that cool-girl edge of the contemporary and bohemian-inspired clothing line.
