Our dogs obviously love them, but finding one that'll last more than 20 minutes can be impossible.</p><p>While no plush toy is ever going to be truly indestructible (meaning it'll last years), there are a handful that are better than others. In our home, an indestructible dog toy is one that lasts 6+ weeks. Even though we know our dog will destroy them, they're one of her favorite types of toys, so it's a cost we're willing to eat every couple of months.</p><p>Of course, we have to include a disclaimer here: if your dog is prone to eating the stuffing or fabric from plush toys: <strong>do not give them these toys</strong>. Ingesting stuffing or fabric can lead to a host of gastrointestinal issues, with some including surgical intervention to fix.</p><p>With all of that said, Fluff & Tuff toys take the cake for our testers. After weeks of playing, this little rabbit has yet to show even a single hole, and that's because Fluff & Tuff uses double-stitched reinforced seams and a double mesh interior lining. So while the outside is a fuzzy, soft exterior that dogs love, the interior stands up well to gnawing and gnashing.</p><p>Additionally, Fluff & Tuff embroiders on eyes, so you won't have to worry about Fido ingesting any beads (which are also harmful). And if they do happen to eat some of the stuffing, Fluff & Tuff uses a non-toxic stuff that should make it easier on dogs to flush out. <strong></strong></p><p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>After nearly six months of daily play, this little rabbit is still going strong! One small hole is the only major sign of wear, and the stuffing hasn't starting coming out, yet. <strong></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLvUp6ursZyew6q6xmeaqKVfobansY6koJ2rXaWytb%2BOoGttbmRngXV%2FjqKlnZ2jqb%2B2r9OimaWdXZm8qHnTqLCsZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
