While I don’t necessarily buy into the big biz of self-care, I am a proponent of being good to myself, especially after particularly long, enervating weeks. And after this most recent New York Fashion Week, there was but one tiny gadget I turned to for a sense of relief: the <a data-pmc-sp-product=2257460d40dfc3e6e3ce78133a2e9715 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Therabody Wave Solo","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Therabody Wave Series Wave Solo - Handheld Bluetooth Enabled Massage Device.

Not only is it intense, but I find it tricky to use on hard-to-reach areas like my upper back, and I hate holding it up when I want to use it for longer periods of time. It’s also not that easy on the eyes, so it often gets shoved in some drawer where I’ll forget about it for ages.</p><p>But not the <a data-pmc-sp-product=2257460d40dfc3e6e3ce78133a2e9715 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Therabody Wave Solo","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Therabody Wave Series Wave Solo - Handheld Bluetooth Enabled Massage Device.

She’s the MVP of my wellness routine. Unlike the Theragun, the Wave Solo is a discrete little vibrating <a href=# id=auto-tag_massage data-tag=massage>massage</a> ball, one I can perch on any side table without it drawing too much attention. Hell, it looks like abstract home decor!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-from-iOS-1-1.jpg><p>But this <a href=# id=auto-tag_review data-tag=review>review</a> isn’t about looks—it’s about how it makes me feel. This thing utilizes <a href=# id=auto-tag_therabody data-tag=therabody>Therabody</a>‘s QuietRoll technology to emanate three speeds of powerful-but-quiet vibration that you can use to reduce tension, ease soreness and more. And because it’s so small and compact, you can use it pretty much anywhere.</p><p>Ever use a tennis ball or lacrosse ball to DIY a lower back massage? Take a seat and drop the <a data-pmc-sp-product=68f701eb2c2ab04ae7d15f4f09351a04 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Wave Solo","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Therabody Wave Series Wave Solo - Handheld Bluetooth Enabled Massage Device.

I sit with the ball behind me for a few minutes each day and the payoff is absolutely mind-blowing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-23-at-2.16.04-PM.png><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$59.99 (Originally $79.99)</span></p><p>After New York Fashion Week, when my feet are sore and swollen from running around in heels for hours on end, I turn on the ball and cradle it between my feet hands-free while I lounge on the couch or watch TV. It’s practically mindless, and it makes a major difference.</p><p>Last but not least, my partner and I use the<a data-pmc-sp-product=b7228e90f4ce45696af46a1f8a939188 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Wave Solo","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Therabody Wave Series Wave Solo - Handheld Bluetooth Enabled Massage Device.

The idea of giving your boo a massage sounds romantic, but they usually aren’t all that great at actually messaging you effectively—not to mention it’s a lot of work for the partner playing masseuse. We find using the Wave Solo on one another easy and fun, and because there’s really no wrong or dangerous way to do it, there’s no pressure.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-from-iOS-2-1.jpg><p class=body-copy>If you do want some guidance, though, you can connect to the Therabody app via BlueTooth and gain access to guided warm-ups and routines which make the most of the Wave Solo for the feet, glutes, legs and back. And if you become addicted (like me), you’ll appreciate the easy-to-charge USB-C port and two-hour battery life.</p><p>Given how portable this little ball is, you best believe I take it with me almost everywhere when I travel. And I’ve been in the habit of gifting it to all my on-the-go friends, too. For most of us, it’s replaced our bulky <a href=# rel=nofollow>Theraguns</a> for everyday massaging and tension relief—and while I love both gadgets, this little vibrating massage ball is the clear frontrunner for me.</p><p class=body-copy>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZK%2BmrdStsGhpYmqAeXyQaKuhnaKWr7Cw2Gaumq6VYsCwuM5mraKaopbBqrrGZqSaq6OWtKZ5wZqjpWWimsOqsdZo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
