The couple welcomed their daughter Liza in March 1946, but parted ways in 1951. Judy married businessman Sid Luft in June 1952, and they remained together for 13 years, by far her longest relationship. They had two children together – Lorna Luft, born in November 1952, and Joey Luft, born in March 1955. The couple divorced in May 1965, and in November that same year she married Mark Herron in Las Vegas; they separated five months later, and Judy was granted a divorce in 1976. Her final marriage was to Mickey Deans. They dated on-and-off for three years before they wed in March 1969. The couple were married for just three months before Judy passed away on 22 June, 1969.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
