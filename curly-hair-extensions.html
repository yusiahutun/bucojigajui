Finding the right curly hair extensions that match your natural curl pattern can be tricky. That's why shopping for hair extensions requires time and research. Luckily for you, we tapped two experts on the topic to discuss everything you need to know before getting your curly hair extensions.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-do-you-need-to-consider-before-getting-curly-hair-extensions></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Do You Need to Consider Before Getting Curly Hair Extensions?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before getting your extensions, first consider your curl pattern, density, and length. "To get a great blend, you should have enough hair to hide the hair extension wefts," says Soleil Guerrero, creator of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noopener>Bebonia Curly Hair Extensions</a>. The founder adds that your hair needs to be at least chin-length for the best results. "Next, think about the density of your hair as this will determine how dense your extensions should be."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noopener>LeAna McKnight</a>, a celebrity stylist and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="noopener nofollow">SL Raw Virgin Hair</a>, a textured extensions brand, says figuring out your curl pattern can help you determine the density of your hair and extensions. "Properly knowing your curl pattern and hair type will help you in the purchasing process on how many bundles of hair you'll need and choosing the correct curl pattern to best match your hair," she says. Typically, the finer your hair type is, the less amount of hair you'll need and vice-versa.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-the-types-of-curly-hair-extensions></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Are the Types of Curly Hair Extensions?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">McKnight explains that there are four types of textured hair extensions. She says when picking which type works best for you, you need to determine what hairstyle and goals you're trying to achieve. Are you looking for versatility, a protective style, or want extra length and volume? "Based on what you choose, you may need weft hair bundles, keratin I-tip link, clip-ins, or a wig," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sew-in wefts are great for adding length and density. "I-tips (which are similar to micro-links) are perfect for those who don't like tension but want something more permanent with awesome versatility," says McKnight. "Clip-ins are great for self-installation (DIY) for adding length and volume, and wigs are a great protective style for self-installation while adding volume and length."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-do-you-match-your-curl-pattern></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Do You Match Your Curl Pattern?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To find the right extensions, you need to determine your curl pattern. McKnight recommends cutting a single strand of hair and comparing it to the hair patterns on a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>curl pattern chart</a>. "Usually curly hair extensions will specify what curl pattern it is from 2A-2C, 3A-3C, 4A-4C," she says. "If you already know your hair curl type, then this will be easy to match."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, if you don't know your curl pattern, most hair extension companies offer an exchange policy or help you determine which hair extension is best for you. For instance, Bebonia has a free personal matching service.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We can do a live consultation or consult via photos," says Guerrero. "When sending in photos, take selfies in natural light (ideally not in direct sunlight) so that both your curl pattern and color are visible. When you order a set of Bebonia extensions, you'll get a tester weft to ensure that the extensions match your texture and color to your liking." If the weft isn't a match, the company will accommodate a return or exchange if the main compartment of the original packaging is still sealed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The same goes for SL Raw Virgin Hair, which offers a 30-day policy where you can exchange your unused curly hair extensions for the correct curl pattern.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So to reiterate, if you aren't sure of your curl type, make sure to review the exchange policies of the company where you're buying the extensions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Dealing With Dry Natural Hair? These Products Are Ready to Flip the Script</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-the-installation-process-for-curly-hair-extensions-like></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is the Installation Process for Curly Hair Extensions Like?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The installation will depend on the type of hair extension you choose. If you opt for clip-in extensions, Guerrero says a tip is to work from the bottom up. "Clip the first weft upside down to conceal any shorter ends of your natural hair from peaking through â€” this hack is a game-changer," she says. "Create clear, vertical sections to make installation easier." Pro-tip: feel free to mix and match different curl patterns in your hair as it's common for people to have two to three curl patterns in their hair naturally, explains Guerrero. Also, never apply hair extensions to either your wet hair or when the extensions are wet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Other general tips for installing natural curly hair extensions are to shampoo and condition your hair beforehand. "Most natural curly hair extensions have been lightly steamed to achieve these curls and coils, so cleansing hair before is a great preparation before installing," says McKnight. "When ready to install, be gentle when opening up your pack of hair extensions and separate the curly hairs slowly one by one so you don't unwind any curls that may have clustered together."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-do-you-maintain-curly-hair-extensions></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Do You Maintain Curly Hair Extensions?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If your hair extensions are made from human hair, the maintenance will be similar to your curly hair routine. "Remember <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener nofollow">curly hair extensions</a> should be treated just as you would your real hair," says McKnight. "You need to moisturize, detangle, and preserve hair at night time with a silk bonnet or scarf."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To minimize tangling and matting, brush your hair daily with a detangling brush while wet, explains McKnight. She also recommends applying a leave-in conditioner daily, starting from the ends of your hair and distributing it throughout your hair. "Your curly extensions will benefit from more <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener nofollow">frequent deep conditioning</a> since they won't benefit from your scalp's natural oils as your actual hair will," affirms Guerrero.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to conditioning, you'll also need to wash the extensions once a week, just like your natural hair. Another important part of maintenance is storage. Make sure you're laying your extensions neatly in silk or satin in a cool and dry area. The goal is to protect them from getting wet, tangled, or squished when you're not wearing them.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-long-do-curly-hair-extensions-last></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Long Do Curly Hair Extensions Last?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If you are detangling properly, deep conditioning regularly, and storing your extensions properly (in a dry area, neatly stacked, ideally in a satin/silk liner that won't suck the moisture from the hair â€” like a<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> satin storage bag</a>), your curly extensions will last between six months and two years depending on the level of care and wear," says Guerrero.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is All Natural.
