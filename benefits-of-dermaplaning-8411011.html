That's the idea behind <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>dermaplaning</a>, a method of exfoliation. The in-office version involves to use of a surgical scalpel while the at-home version uses a single-blade razor to scrape away dullness. "Essentially, dermaplaning is shaving your skin with a razor or sharp blade, plus removal of a little more of the top layer of skin the stratum corneum," says board-certified dermatologist Anar Mikailov, MD. "It’s easy to do, there's not much downtime, and it's generally safe."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead, you'll find everything you need to know about dermaplaning, including its benefits and drawbacks.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><span class=heading-toc id=toc-benefits-of-dermaplaning></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Benefits of Dermaplaning</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Removal of Unwanted Facial Hair</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Dermaplaning uses a blade to shave the vellus facial hair, that fine fuzz most visible on your lateral cheeks," says board-certified dermatologist Ranella Hirsch, MD. So it's great for anyone experiencing unwanted facial hair. Dr.&nbsp;Mikailov adds that "many women who have a higher density of facial hair really love this procedure."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Enhanced Product Absorption</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Because hair and dead skin is removed during this dermaplaning, board-certified dermatologist&nbsp; Bertha Baum, DO, explains that it can enhance the effectiveness of skin-care products. "By eliminating the barrier of dead skin cells and peach fuzz, skin-care products can penetrate the skin more effectively, leading to better results from serums, moisturizers, and other skin-care treatments, contributing to a brighter and more radiant complexion," says Dr, Baum.</p><p>"Consider dermaplaning with a thicker cream that has coconut oil (<a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Skintensive Daily Moisturizer</a> or <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Cetaphil</a>) instead of shaving cream—this will help prevent irritation," says Dr.&nbsp;Mikailov.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Smoother Skin</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Generally after this procedure, skin looks smoother without all of that hair/fuzz," says Dr. Mikailov. "Many women love how this procedure allows their makeup to look smooth."<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Brighter Skin</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Dermaplaning can help brighten the skin because the procedure involves exfoliating the outermost layer of the skin, revealing fresher, healthier skin underneath and leading to a brighter complexion," says Dr. Baum. "The removal of dead skin cells through dermaplaning promotes skin cell turnover, which can improve the skin's texture and overall appearance."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Potential Wrinkle Prevention</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There is a hypothesis that dermaplaning or shaving regularly decreases wrinkling based on observations that areas on men's faces that are shaved daily have fewer wrinkles," says Dr. Mikailov.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Instant Results</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike more intense services, you see the difference from dermaplaning as soon as it's over. "Instant results can be seen after a session," says Dr. Baum. "And, there is typically little-to-no downtime associated with dermaplaning, allowing patients to resume their regular activities immediately after the procedure."<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-downsides-of-dermaplaning></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Downsides of Dermaplaning</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Irritation</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"In a small percentage of users dermaplaning can trigger an irritation reaction, which leads to red stinging sensation of the face," says Dr. Mikailov.

These bumps are known as folliculitis and they're a common side effect of shaving. They're caused by an infection of the follicle.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Exacerbation of Skin Conditions</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Dermaplaning is not suitable for individuals with active acne or inflamed skin conditions, eczema, or psoriasis, as it can exacerbate these conditions," says Dr. Baum.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-frequently-asked-questions-c4786e33-2416-431f-bba7-720e1396b15b></span><h2 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__title>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content mntl-accordion js-accordion" readability=50><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=1 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Will dermaplaning cause hair to grow back thicker or darker?</span></p><p>"After dermaplaning, the fine vellus hair, commonly known as peach fuzz, will eventually grow back and typically feels the same as it did before the dermaplaning procedure," says Dr. Baum.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=2 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How does at-home dermaplaning differ from in-office dermaplaning?</span></p><p>"In office, the tools are generally a little stronger," says Dr. Mikailov.
