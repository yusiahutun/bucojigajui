The doctors say that in order for her to heal properly, they recommend she not perform for a couple of weeks. Unfortunately, this overlaps our five tour dates in May … We deeply apologize for this delay and inconvenience. It's always upsetting to have to disappoint her fans, band, crew and our promoters, but sometimes unforeseen things just happen.”</p><p>"Thankfully, Bonnie’s in great hands," the statement continues. "She was so looking forward to these shows, but we’re excited to be able to resume our 2023 tour, now kicking off in Dublin, Ireland, June 1st. Thank you for your well wishes and understanding, and we very much appreciate your respecting her request for privacy at this healing time."</p><p>The news affects five planned performances.
