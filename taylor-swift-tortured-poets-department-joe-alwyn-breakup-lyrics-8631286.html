"I wish I could un-recall how we almost had it all," Swift wrote alongside a black-and-white image of her peeking through the transparent LP on Instagram.&nbsp;And while she didn't provide any further explanation for the quote, Swifties came to the collective conclusion that she was referring to her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>breakup with Joe Alwyn</a>.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Taylor’s new album has already broken me before it’s been released,” wrote one fan in the comments section of her post, while another similarly pointed out that the line is "so sad" and how the album is "going to destroy everyone." Others jokingly threatened to invoice Alwyn for their "therapy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This isn't the first time Swifties have suspected that The Tortured Poets Department is a breakup album dedicated to Alwyn. After Swift announced the name of her forthcoming record at the 2024 Grammys, fans honed in on the title itself, particularly the word "Tortured," believing it was a clever reference to the actor's&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>"Tortured Man Club" group chat</a>. Their suspicions were further confirmed after Swift dropped the album's track list, which includes a song called "So Long, London."<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Swift and Alwyn dated for six years, before breaking up in early 2023. The singer has since moved with NFL star Travis Kelce, while Alwyn has been rumored to be romantically involved with his Brutalist co-star Emma Laird.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK5705qwpaeiYsC4tcWtZK2noqnCs7HDZqeonaSoeqWxz5qpraWVo8Futs6eZJqkp667bq7RnpikraBiubq%2ByJyqZnBmaH5zhJU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
