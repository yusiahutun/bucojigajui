It’s a challenging profession, and a good manager needs to be across all aspects of their client’s business – be they an artist, a songwriter or a producer. However, many managers also face financial uncertainty, particularly in the early stages of their career, and we fear that without proper support the music industry will lose vital talent from across the country,” said MMF’s Fiona McGugan.</p><p>“By partnering with YouTube Music, the Accelerator Programme offers a way of addressing this dilemma. The programme is for managers who are already building a track record, and our aim is to encourage applications from across England and Scotland, across all genres and backgrounds, and to leave a lasting legacy that serves a whole generation of artists,” McGugan added.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZoVwfY9oaHFnnarAqq%2BMppinmZeav7R5xaiprqVdpa6zwM2eqaxlp57BqXnYqKytrZKaerW7jKWYrqaTnXqurc2anp6qXZawpLHLnqmarJ%2BnerG%2BzqCpmqVf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
