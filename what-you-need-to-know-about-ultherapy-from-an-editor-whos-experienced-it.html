And sadly, no matter what you do, these areas cannot be tightened and smoothed with lifestyle measures, so what’s the answer?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For Katy Young, Harper’s Bazaar Group Luxury Beauty Editor, it was Ultherapy – the non-invasive skin-tightening treatment that lifts and sculpts targeted areas of skin. “Understanding that the procedure was essentially an anti-ageing treatment meant it was an obvious choice,” she says. “The ultrasound works on the foundation of the skin, boosting natural collagen to result in firmer, fresher-looking skin. Celebrities have been known to use it as a new facelift alternative.”</p><img alt="katy young" title="katy young" width=2083 height=2083 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hq-ultherapy-comps-v1-1665044936.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Hearst</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dr Matthew Jarvie-Thomas, a cosmetic doctor with a special interest in advanced non-surgical aesthetics and anatomy, backs this reasoning, adding: “Ultherapy offers a non-surgical way to lift and tighten the skin. Many of our patients at the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cosmeticskinclinic.com/premium-brands/ultherapy/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cosmetic Skin Clinic" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Cosmetic Skin Clinic</u></a> are bothered by jowls and losing the sharpness in their jawline and neck. Ultherapy targets the production of collagen and elastin – the scaffolding of youthful skin – making it a great option to generate that lift.”<br></p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Common concerns</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I’ll be candid,” says Katy, “I found the experience a little painful because it works on the deep dermal layers. It was like having a headache in the skin, so I would recommend taking a painkiller beforehand. However, the pain doesn’t last beyond the treatment.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dr Jarvie-Thomas agrees, revealing that the most common question patients ask is whether it will be painful. He goes on to explain that while some patients may experience low-level discomfort, Ultherapy should not be a painful treatment: “We prepare our patients with numbing cream and painkillers pre-treatment.”</p><img alt="lady skincare ultherapy" title="Studio shot of smiling middle-aged woman with younger skin viewed through glass" width=1999 height=1499 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-522900366-1666618758.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">James Lightbown/Corbis/VCG</span></p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">So, what happens exactly?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dr Jarvie-Thomas explains that “before an Ultherapy treatment, patients should have a thorough consultation with a qualified practitioner to discuss their suitability. During the treatment, imaging is used to give optimal results safely, so your practitioner knows precisely what depths are needing to be treated. The treatment is completely non-invasive and will take 30-90 minutes depending on the areas treated.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Katy elaborates that her in-clinic treatment “took approximately 20-30 minutes using a handheld gadget to deliver ultrasound waves across [her] face and neck”.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>I did not experience any side effects from my treatment<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I did not experience any side effects from my treatment,” says Katy, “although I have heard that mild swelling can occur but subsides within 48 hours.”</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Is it right for you?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Ask yourself if you really, truly need it,” urges Katy. “This absolutely works but is best seen on faces where gravity is beginning to take hold.” She also stresses that it should only be carried out by certified professionals. And her final tip is to ask the clinic to show you examples of previous work, so you feel confident in their hands.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Ultherapy is widely regarded as the gold standard of non-surgical skin tightening, making it a great preventative or regenerative treatment," says Dr Jarvie-Thomas. “My patients love how it gives them the ability to generate their own collagen and while the results come gradually, they will last for years, not months.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Cosmetic Skin Clinic has been the number one Ultherapy treatment provider for nine years in a row.
