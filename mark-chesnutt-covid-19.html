The '90s hitmaker says both he and his wife Tracie are grateful for any warm thoughts and prayers as they face this double recovery.</p><p>Tracie&nbsp;has also tested positive for the virus. Chesnutt is a 57-year-old Texan who notched eight Billboard No. 1 country songs during a career that began with "Too Cold at Home" in 1990. Of his 40 charting songs, 20 have reached the Top 10, including "Going Through the Big D," "It's a Little Too Late" and "I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing." The couple have been married since 1992.</p><p>"Just wanted to give everybody a little update,"&nbsp;the country singer begins in a message to fans. "I am currently on the mend from my back surgery. But, while doing so my wife Tracie and I have tested&nbsp;positive for COVID-19! Thank you all for the continuous prayers."</p><p>In announcing his back surgery in July, Chesnutt shared that the&nbsp;recovery would take two months. It was an urgent surgery that aims to correct a problem he's been dealing with for some time. As a result, he had to cancel all tour dates through early September.</p><p>It's not clear how this might further set back his plans for 2021. Fans responded in great numbers with words of support after Chesnutt shared the&nbsp;COVID-19 test news, but he has not yet spoken to the severity of his symptoms or&nbsp;given further updates.&nbsp;His tweet was sent at 10PM on Aug. 15 and comes as the country is experiencing a serious uptick in COVID-19 cases with the rise of a new variant, Delta.</p><p>The <a href=#>CDC</a> reports that the current seven-day moving average of new daily COVID-19 cases in the United States increased from 19.9 percent from the previous seven-day moving average. Current rates are similar to the rates in late January and early February, up more than five times from the 12 month low in late June 2021.</p><p><h2 class=photogallery-title>See 50 Essential '90s Country Songs</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmppmioHqktMSspa6spGKwsMLInWRqcV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
