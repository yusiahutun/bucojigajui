“You can’t scare me.”  That’s the powerful mantra Hoda Kotb took on after beating breast cancer.  It may have even helped the Dateline correspondent land her current gig as cohost of the fourth hour of NBC’s Today, alongside Kathie Lee Gifford. 
“Those four words can work wonders for you,” Hoda reveals in an interview for Coping® magazine, letting me in on her hard-knock secret."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Instead, she keeps regular follow-up appointments with her physician to make sure the cancer hasn’t come back.</p><p>Regarding her decision to forgo adjuvant therapy, Hoda says, “At the end of the day, when you make whatever choice you make, you have to be able to put your head on the pillow and sleep. &nbsp;Everyone has to make their own decision, but I’m comfortable with mine.”</p><p>Hoda’s next hurdle was deciding whether to speak publicly about her diagnosis. &nbsp;“The idea about going public was a tricky decision,” Hoda says, “because cancer is a part of me, but it’s not all of me. &nbsp;It did shape me, but it doesn’t define me.”</p><p>Hoda ultimately decided to share her breast cancer experience with Today show viewers that October, <strong><a href=#>Breast Cancer Awareness</a></strong> month, fittingly. &nbsp;Although she admits that she sometimes wonders what her life would be like if her cancer was still a secret, in the end, she says, “I would choose the path I took a million times over.”</p><p>That doesn’t mean, however, that talking about something as personal as breast cancer on national TV came easy. &nbsp;As a journalist, she’s long been at ease asking the tough questions, but when she sat down with Ann Curry to discuss her own cancer, Hoda admits that it was a <strong><a href=#>little bit terrifying to be on the other side </a></strong>of the interview. &nbsp;</p><p>“It really did change my perspective on what I do for a living, because it’s a very vulnerable spot to be in,” she says. &nbsp;“I’ve always known that, but I don’t think I realized the extent of it until I was actually sitting in the other chair.”&nbsp;</p><p>Four years later, she’s still at home in her Today show anchor chair – right next to Kathie Lee – with a new perspective, a fearless attitude, and a cancer-free left breast. &nbsp;“I used to wake up and think of myself as someone with cancer,” Hoda says, “and now, now I just wake up.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/mediaamerica.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Hoda-Kotb-320.jpg><p>This article was published in&nbsp;Coping® with Cancer&nbsp;magazine, September/October 2011.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6W2r7PMmp5nm5%2BifKO%2BxJqqrWWTlruksdFmqq6qpp7DsL6MoaadmV2gvLWujg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
