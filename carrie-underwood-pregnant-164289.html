Click here for info on The Cry Pretty Tour 360!” she wrote in the caption of her Instagram announcement, and unsuspecting fans thought it was just an announcement for her upcoming album and tour — but she had even more exciting news to share.</p><p>“You might be wondering or asking, ‘Carrie, why is your tour starting in May?’ Well…yay!” the 35-year-old said as the camera panned out, revealing the word “baby” spelled out above her in silver letter balloons. “Mike and Isaiah and I are absolutely over the moon and excited to be adding another little fish to our pond. This has just been a dream come true with [the] album and with baby news and all that stuff. We’re just so excited.”</p><p>But Carrie and her family aren’t the only ones that are super excited — all of her fans are so happy for her, too! They flooded the comments with their well wishes and congratulated the “Cry Pretty” singer on her pregnancy. “Congrats to you and Mike, it’s time for a girl hockey player!” one fan wrote, while another commented, “Congratulations to you, Mike, and Isaiah! So happy for you. Excited about the album and tour!”</p><p>Carrie and her NHL player hubby are already parents to a three-year-old son named Isaiah, so it would be so cute if their next bundle of joy would be a baby girl. But Carrie didn’t reveal any more details about her prengancy just yet like her due date or her baby’s gender, but it can be speculated that baby No. 2 could be due sometime before Carrie’s tour starts next May.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46cmKuqmZp6trrDnqmwp5%2BZerG%2BxKClmqakYn53gJFxcGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
