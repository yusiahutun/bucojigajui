But a guy can text you daily and not even be interested in you. For example, he texts you every day to talk about sex or constantly responds with memes.</p><p class=align-left>Conversely, he may take a long time to text you, but the messages show he is more interested in you. Unless you know how guys text when they like you, it may be challenging to get an answer to their intentions.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b039bbbecdf66b0c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30 pranks to do on your boyfriend to test how much he loves you</span></p></a><h2>Would a player text you every day?</h2><p class=align-left>It is never easy to know a player’s intentions. If he is trying to manipulate you emotionally, he will do anything to make you believe he is in love with you. But, of course, that also means he will text you every day or occasionally.</p><p class=align-left>One thing to understand is that even if a guy texts you daily or occasionally, you can be confident that he is interested in something you have to offer. Therefore, you have to move fast to understand his intentions. Otherwise, he could be playing you.</p><h2>How often do guys text if they like you?</h2><p class=align-left>Guys are different. Some text you a lot. Others take their time. But when a guy texts you often, it means he is more interested in you. However, the frequency of his text messages does not mean anything.</p><p class=align-left>A guy may text you a lot because he is playing you and trying to manipulate you emotionally. Also, he can text you frequently because he is desperate. In other cases, he will only text you occasionally, probably after two or three days. If you want to know whether he likes you, look at the content of his text messages.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d3497a3f3c893d12.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What does it mean when a guy flirts with you but has a girlfriend?</span></p></a><h2>How guys text when they like you</h2><p class=align-left>The content of a guy’s text can speak a lot and help you determine whether he likes you or not. If you want to be sure about his intentions, here are ways guys hint they like you through text.</p><h3>1. He asks questions about your life</h3><p class=align-left>When a guy likes you, he will ask you many questions about you or your life. For example, he will want to know more about your childhood, hopes and dreams, and what makes you happiest.</p><p class=align-left>The guy will ask you about your <a href=#>family</a>, likes and dislikes, favourite colour, your <a href=#>job</a>, troubles, or even want to know how you fared during the day. An interested guy will also avoid asking you creepy questions.</p><h3>2. He replies quickly</h3><p class=align-left>A quick reply from a guy during texting offers a sure way of knowing whether he is interested in talking to you. He has responded fast because he likes you and wants to hear what you say. Furthermore, the quick reply could suggest he is open and honest because he did not think about it.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/702f949ea511d852.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>When to leave a relationship: 15 signs you should give up on him</span></p></a><h3>3. He compliments you all the time</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b039bbbecdf66b0c.jpg><p class=align-left>One tell-tale sign that a man likes you is that he looks for any opportunity to compliment you. Therefore, he will take his time on the phone trying to find the best words to compliment you.</p><p class=align-left>A compliment about your appearance indicates that he is into you. Also, when he emotionally compliments you via text, praising your kindness, devotion, and sincerity, he tells you he likes you.</p><h3>4. He replies with the heart emoji</h3><p class=align-left>Guys use the heart emoji to express romance. If he sends you the throbbing heart emoji, it means he likes you and is into you. Furthermore, a red heart emoji is shared in a warm emotional context. When you receive it from a guy, he expresses his gratitude, love, or happiness. The heart could also mean he is being flirtatious.</p><h3>5. He texts you first</h3><p class=align-left>When a guy texts you first, whether in the morning or randomly, it could mean a lot of things. The most obvious reason is that he enjoys talking to you. But a person cannot enjoy talking to you if he does not like you. Therefore, getting a text from him first indicates that he likes you. It can also signify that he is thinking about you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6aa5ae642a8f5867.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 signs your baby daddy wants you back but is scared to tell you</span></p></a><h3>6. He writes you long texts</h3><p class=align-left>While it may not often happen, a guy who likes you will be comfortable writing you a long text message. He may even break it into several sections to put his message across. However, the content of the text message is crucial to decipher. If he sends you a long <a href=#>sweet message,</a> it implies he likes you.</p><h3>7. He does not send multiple texts simultaneously</h3><p class=align-left>Double texting can be confusing to decipher. In some cases, it could mean a guy is interested in you. However, a shy guy texting habit is to avoid sending you multiple texts because it makes him look desperate.</p><p class=align-left>If he likes you, he will give you time to respond. But if he sends you many texts simultaneously, it implies he is clingy and possessive. Also, it could mean he wants to control the flow of the conversation.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e99c66cc474ef907.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 signs he doesn't care about the relationship and what to do</span></p></a><h3>8. He personalises his texts</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d3497a3f3c893d12.jpeg><p class=align-left>One way in which a guy can personalise his texts is by including your name. Generally, when a guy includes your name in a text, it creates a feeling of intimacy. Also, the personalisation draws you closer to him.</p><p class=align-left>When you read your name in the <a href=#>message</a>, you feel understood, respected, and acknowledged. Another reason is that he wants to get your attention through text.</p><h3>9. He texts you randomly</h3><p class=align-left>Perhaps the best way to know whether a guy likes you is when he texts you randomly. Of course, a <a href=#>random text </a>can mean different things depending on the relationship. However, it could mean he misses you. The guy may also send you the text in the middle of the day if he wants to check up on you and determine how things are going on with you.</p><h3>10. He never gives excuses</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/29e54fd96a8331c8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ quotes about broken trust and promises in a relationship</span></p></a><p class=align-left>People often give excuses to justify a fault or an offence. Its primary goal is to lessen responsibility and get you to overlook what he did or even forgive him. But when a guy never gives you excuses, it means he likes you and has taken responsibility for what has happened. So, for example, he will not give excuses for not replying to your texts even though he knows he was busy at work.</p><p class=align-left>Unless you understand or know how guys text when they like you, it will be challenging for you to determine their intentions. However, you will know he likes you if he asks questions about your life, replies quickly to your texts, complements you all the time, texts you randomly, personalises his texts, or replies with a heart emoji. But if he only talks about sex or responds with memes, he is not interested in you and could be playing you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c080f0700572d346.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to pull away emotionally from a guy you love</span></p></a><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke </a>shared an interesting article about the top 10 signs he <a href=#>doesn't care about the relationship </a>and what to do.
