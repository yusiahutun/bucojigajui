She is unable to hear herself when she is performing-whether she is acting or singing. When playing Eleven, who didn't talk much in Stranger Things' first season, Brown used her other senses, "I can talk with my face," she explains. "It's easy to say 'I'm mad' or I’m sad. I’m angry.’ I have to just do it with my face.” <a rel=nofollow href=# class="looms--artdiv loomsart--logodiv loomsart--logodiv-v2" onclick='trigger17LoomsEntryClick("17Looms_AP_Logo","-","-","-")'><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/images/17looms_pinkvilla_deshtop_article_entry_updated.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Fantasy fiction has always drawn <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click"," ‘I don&#39;t care if I sound bad’: Millie Bobby Brown Does Not Shy Away From Doing What She Loves","1296435","https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/jon-bon-jovi-shares-his-thoughts-on-millie-bobby-brown-and-jake-bongiovis-marriage-says-they-will-grow-together-1295963","articlepage","/entertainment/hollywood/i-dont-care-if-i-sound-bad-millie-bobby-brown-does-not-shy-away-from-doing-what-she-loves-1296435","Millie Bobby Brown","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","hollywood")'>Millie Bobby Brown</a>&nbsp;since she began her acting career. The nine-year-old actor first appeared in the American fantasy drama Once Upon a Time in Wonderland in 2013. She has since produced numerous fantasy projects, from Stranger Things (2016) to the Enola Holmes series which marked her debut as a producer. With Damsel, her latest Netflix original, she deconstructs an age-old fairytale, ripping out princes, princesses, prosperous kingdoms and ferocious dragons.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p><img alt="Millie Bobby Brown (PC: Millie Bobby Brown's Instagram)" title="Millie Bobby Brown (PC: Millie Bobby Brown's Instagram)" width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2024-04/1713357566_millie-bobby-brown-5-1.jpg></p><h3 id=661fc31a4f87f><strong>Millie’s passionate about all things art</strong></h3><p>Millie Bobby Brown has found her love for acting despite hurdles. As for her desire to act, Brown told Variety, "It was like a bug. When I find something I love, nothing stops me from doing it. If I don't know how to sew, and I have a passion for it, I'm going to sew. That's also true with acting. So here I am."</p><p><img alt="Millie Bobby Brown (PC: Getty Images)" title="Millie Bobby Brown (PC: Getty Images)" width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2024-04/1713355840_millie-bobby-brown-3-1.jpg></p><h3 id=661fc31a4f886><strong>Brown has not a care in the world till she loves what she does</strong></h3><p>The fact that Brown has partial hearing loss could shake a young actress's confidence, but she has never let it do so. "I just started singing, and I don't care if I sound bad, I'm just doing what I love," she said. It doesn't matter if you're good at singing, dancing, or acting. If you enjoy it, then do it. No one should stop you."</p><p>"I'm open to different kinds of entertainment, but I definitely think fantasy connects with people more," says the 20-year-old via Zoom. “Fantasy projects are great because our world is so scary today. It is intimidating for young people to turn on the news or go on social media."
