Is She Expecting?</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-02-25</div><p>Like so many famous women, “Hailey Bieber is pregnant” is a rumor that gets tossed around a lot. Ever since her relationship with Justin was solidified in marriage in 2018 after hard-launching with their romance two years earlier.</p><p>The celebrity power couple goes way back. The pair was introduced in 2009 by Hailey’s dad, the actor Stephen Baldwin. However, Justin was with Selena Gomez at the time. Hailey and Justin met again in 2011, but it wasn’t until 2016 during one of Justin’s breaks from Selena that rumors of a budding romance between Justin and Hailey began to circulate. At the end of 2015, Hailey and Justin’s flirty interactions were documented on Instagram. It all came to a head when Justin shared&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>a photo</a>&nbsp;of locking lips with Hailey in 2016.</p><p>After a short breakup and reunion, Justin proposed during an intimate vacation to the Bahamas. Justin shared the news via Instagram after the tabloids had picked up on the story, noting in a very long caption: “Was gonna wait a while to say anything but word travels fast, listen plain and simple Hailey I am soooo in love with everything about you! So committed to<a href=#>&nbsp;spending my life&nbsp;</a>getting to know every single part of you loving you patiently and kindly.”</p><p>They married in a courthouse wedding in September 2018, just four months after reuniting and two months after announcing their engagement. A year later, they celebrated their love again at their second wedding in South Carolina. Since then, she’s battled multiple Hailey Bieber pregnancy rumors and has had to hit back every time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=hailey-bieber-pregnancy-rumors-and-the-truth>Hailey Bieber pregnancy: Rumors and the truth</h2><p>Here’s everything Hailey Bieber has said about being pregnant.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.4144144144144><h2>April 2017</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hailey-baldwin-2-1.jpg><p>Hailey Bieber’s pregnancy rumors first started in 2017 (when she was 21, btw), when she stepped out at the Daily Front Row Fashion Awards wearing a babydoll dress with a cinched waist. She simply responded with a&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>tweet</a>, joking, “Yes, I’m pregnant and&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Kendall Jenner</a>&nbsp;is the baby mama.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.7489177489177><h2>July 2018</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1028543008.jpg><p>In July 2018, paparazzi approached Justin Bieber to ask: “Is Hailey pregnant right now? You stated that you guys are family, so everybody was thinking she might be pregnant.” In response, Justin said to the unidentified cameraman: “What’s your deal, bro? You just seem too, like, you just seem too normal to be doing this job…I just don’t understand why you gotta try to get a rise, you know what I’m saying?” Bieber said.</p><p>After the man tried to defend his actions, Justin said: “No, you know what you’re doing,” and asked for the camera to be turned off.

After photos emerged in November 2019 with her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">hand over her stomach</a>, Hailey responded with a post to her Instagram stories: “The internet is funny!” Hailey wrote in white letters over an all-black background. “No, I’m not pregnant. I just really love food.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=16.695846645367><h2>April 2022</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bieber-hailer.jpg><p>On April 4, 2022, RadarOnline posted on Instagram that “<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>a little Bieber</a>” might be “on the way” after she walked the Grammys red carpet with Justin wearing a flowing gown.</p><p>“The model was a vision on Sunday wearing a white #SaintLaurent gown while joined by her husband, #JustinBieber, for the star-studded ceremony, and some fans felt it was a carefully crafted style choice,” RadarOnline&nbsp;captioned the post, mentioning that Hailey might’ve had “what appeared to be a ‘baby bump.'”</p><p>“I’m not pregnant leave me alone,” Hailey wrote in the comment section and fans backed her up. “Leave her alone!!!!” one person wrote. Another said, “Stop speculating on people’s bodies.” A third added, “Literally NOBODY said she was pregnant besides y’all.”</p><p>&nbsp;In an interview with&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>WSJ. Magazine</a>, Hailey said she wasn’t ready to have kids yet, but “I think ideally in the next couple of years we would try. But there’s a reason they call it try, right? You don’t know how long that process is ever going to take.”</p><p>She continued: “There’s this thing that happens for women when you get married. Everybody always assumes it’s: First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes the baby. Well, what about all the things I want to accomplish in my business? I think I had it ingrained in my head that I was going to want to have kids right away and I was going to want to have kids super, super young. Then I turned 25 and I’m like, I’m still super, super young!”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=10.90782122905><h2>May 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hailey-bieber.jpg><p>Once again, rumors are going around on TikTok/social media in general that because of her outfit choices, Hailey Bieber is pregnant—with some saying she’s 6 months along. “This makes a lot of sense,” one person speculated, “I mean, Hailey – who’s always used to strutting her stuff with her tummy out – has been wearing super baggy clothes, baggy jackets. Even at Coachella she was really covered up. I cannot wait to see what baby Bieber looks like!”</p><p>Another “fan” judged: “I don’t think she’s 6 months, but I do think she’s pregnant. Those vaca pictures weren’t flat belly. Coachella was though, so I think it’s very early.” One agreed: “I think she is. I think they are both putting up the BIGGEST front to keep it out of the media, including posing with drinks, etc. But I guess time will tell,” said a second&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>social media</a>&nbsp;user. “I think she’s def pregnant and I think everyone saying ‘Justin is sad’ is kind of being delulu tbh lol. If anything he’s happy she’s finally giving him a child,” said a third.</p><p>Despite fans defending her against tabloid speculation, it seems people on social media are more than happy to speculate and cast judgment themselves. Hailey hasn’t responded and we don’t expect her to because at this point, she probably feels like a broken record.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=17.170477471419><h2>October 2023</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/hailey-bieber-vitamin-c-serum.png><p>In an interview with GQ Hype, Hailey spoke about how the pregnancy rumors have affected her over the years. “Recently, everybody was like, ‘Oh, my God, she’s pregnant,’ and that’s happened to me multiple times before,” she said. “There is something <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">that’s disheartening about</a>, Damn, I can’t be bloated one time and not be pregnant? It would be a lie if I was like, ‘Oh, yeah, I don’t give a shit.’”</p><p>She continued: “When there comes a day that that is true, you—” she fans her hands in the air, gesturing toward the world at large, “you,&nbsp;as in the internet, will be the last to know,” adding, “Maybe I liked the idea at 18 of not raising kids around certain things, but my life is so different now than it was when I was 18,” she says. “It’s so hard to say what I’m going to do or not do when there isn’t even a child here yet. I don’t even know what it feels like to be a parent other than a dog parent yet. And that’s not the same thing, by any means.”</p><p>Motherhood “is something that I look forward to. It’s also such a private, intimate thing. It’s something that’s going to come when it comes. And it’s just, honestly, at the end of the day, so hilarious how much people fucking care. Let me do what I want to do with my body and you guys can do what you want to do with your body—and let’s just let it be that.”</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfna6quMSyZJuhlZeys3nPq5ygppGjwXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
