The sub-freezing temperatures didn't seem to bother him (like, in ANY way) as he strolled in completely naked, treating viewers to an eyeful of his unhooded justice.</p><p>"Honestly, you work hard, you get in shape and then... it's fun!" the 33-year-old laughed of shooting the NSFW scene. "It was actually more liberating than anything else."</p><p>"I went out there, I said 'I'm young, if you're gonna do it it's not like you can be old, might as well do it while you're young,' you know what I mean?

"I'm a Californian, I'm gonna keep my clothes on right now," he smiled. "There's a time and a place for everything."</p><p>The actor also reacted to the this week's unveiling of the Golden Globes nominations — of which "Watchmen" secured a criminally low zero — shrugging the snub off.</p><p>"I think it's dope to have people be passionate about your work," he said. "Snubbed or not, people are still tuning in. The ratings are good, and we're giving the viewers something to talk about, so more power to us, you know what I mean?"</p><p>The final episode of "Watchmen" airs on HBO on Sunday.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
