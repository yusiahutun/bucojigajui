But here’s the thing: Today’s the last day to take advantage of this offer. The deal stops at midnight.</p><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=#>6 SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic Serum Dupes That Are Just as Effective & Will Save You Big Time</a></p><p>To <a href=# rel=nofollow>get a Skinceuticals vitamin C serum for free</a>, you have to spend $250 or more on any of the brand’s products, then use promo code <strong>CEF</strong> at discount.&nbsp;It’s no small spend, but name another time when you can get Skinceuticals favorites for free. Plus, you know when you’re shopping the best of the best skincare here. Trust me, <a href=#>I’ve tried just about everything from them</a> and can contest whatever you get will be worth every damn penny.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/c-e-ferulic-with-15-l-ascorbic-acid-635494263008-skinceuticals-alt-1.webp><h2>C E Ferulic Acid</h2><p>The C E Ferulic Acid is worth every d*mn penny. Yes, it’s $169, but this serum lasted me half a year—and did wonders for my skin. It’s <a href=# rel=nofollow>clinically proven to protect skin against environmental damage</a>&nbsp;and living in New York, I’m prone to a whole lot of that. The vitamin C serum is effective for up to three days worth of time, so even if I skipped a few applications here and there, my skin would never dull or lose its glow. Not to mention, it didn’t ever leave my skin feeling dry like a lot of other vitamin C serums have. I have combination skin, so it’s difficult to find serums that won’t make my face oily or patchy.</p><p>I’d recommend you buy this if you’re concerned about <a href=# rel=nofollow>fine lines, wrinkles, or environmental stressors</a>. It’s very brightening and creates a nice dewiness, as well, so if you’re in the market for something to help your skin glow, this is the product for you.</p><p>Unlike other vitamin C serums that typically go bad after three months, this one stays fresh for half a year. The unique blend of &nbsp;L-ascorbic acid, percent vitamin E and ferulic acid combine to fight off environmental pollutants from wreaking havoc on your skin, while also diminishing signs of aging. According to the brand, it’s “proven to reduce combined oxidative damage generated by UVA/UVB rays, ozone pollution, and diesel engine exhaust by up to 41 percent.”</p><p>So basically it’s an ozone layer and a time machine for your skin. No wonder Hailey Bieber, Gwyneth Paltrow and every other celeb out there loves it.</p><p>“Makes serious changes in your skin,” wrote one five-star reviewer. “After four kids and more than four decades, I’m loving this product to make my skin look fresh and dewy.”</p><p>Use promo code <strong>CEF </strong>at checkout after buying $250+ in products to secure the free 15 mL sample of this—usually worth $85.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Phloretin-CF-with-Ferulic-Acid-635494328004-SkinCeuticals.webp><h2>Phloretin CF With Ferulic Acid</h2><p>Also included in this free sample deal is the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Phloretin CF Serum</a>, a vitamin C serum formulated specifically to help treat discoloration. If you suffer from <a href=#>dark spots, acne scars</a> or hyperpigmentation, this is for you. The vitamin C antioxidant face serum uses a trio of phloretin, pure vitamin C and ferulic acid to protect and treat aging skin. Effective for a whopping 72 hours straight, the product shields your face from environmental irritants like pollution while also improving skin tone and discoloration.</p><p>One shopper called it “magic,” adding that after a few months of consistent use, “my acne scarring completely faded.”</p><p>A sample size of this bottle usually costs $85, but you’ll get it for free when you use promo code <strong>PCF&nbsp;</strong>at checkout after buying $250+ in products.</p><p>So, what exactly should you buy from Skinceuticals <a href=# rel=nofollow>to get a free vitamin C serum</a>? I’ve rounded up some staples below—and but, for the record, I wouldn’t let this promo stop you from buying the big sizes of the <a href=# rel=nofollow>C E Ferulic</a> or <a href=# rel=nofollow>PCF Ferulic serums</a> in addition to receiving the free samples.
