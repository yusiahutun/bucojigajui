The sibling of the much-celebrated "Queen of Tejano music"&nbsp;was filled with compliments for the 37-year-old when talking about this past year's Halloween costumes that paid tribute to Selena on Power 106 Los Angeles radio. "She looked beautiful,"&nbsp;the 50-year-old honestly&nbsp;said to the host. "She looked real Latina. I loved it."&nbsp;Of course, she also weighed in on&nbsp;another big star who opted to publicly pay tribute to the artist for Halloween: <a class=hm-link href=#>Demi Lovato</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/94cf22ea1faa-demi-lovato-selena-z.jpg><p id=eD0S173kedJV data-wc=12><strong>Demi Lovato rocked her own Selena look for Halloween 2017</strong>&nbsp;Photo: Snapchat/@DemiLovato</p><p id=eilBldSlS1YK data-wc=54>Suzette was also flattered by the 25-year-old singer's version of Selena, admitting&nbsp;she can't pick between which star she thought looked better. "I have to tie because they both looked beautiful!"&nbsp;she said. "They're beautiful."&nbsp;Both Kim and Demi wore sparkling and tight maroon jumpsuits, recreating one of Selena's iconic looks.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Twitter</a><p id=eM8CGdCUcVhq data-wc=68>Suzette also revealed that the personality is a long-time lover of her late sister's music. "A lot of people don't know this, but I'm good friends with Adrienne Bailon,"&nbsp;Suzette said, recalling Adrienne's former relationship with Kim's brother <a class=hm-link href=#>Rob Kardashian</a>. "She had Rob on the phone and Kourtney [Kardashian] and all them were in the background and they were all singing my sister's music."</p><p id=ecMT3T7QkMDy data-wc=93>"They're big fans of our music from way back,"&nbsp;she continued. "And so to have her dress like that, it wasn't really a big surprise for me. It was definitely a great honor."&nbsp;Suzette also stuck up for Kim's younger sister Kylie Jenner, who stirred up controversy amongst fans for merely wearing a Selena T-shirt back in 2016. "And then I think Kylie&nbsp;last year was wearing a Selena shirt, and that didn't come as a surprise, either,"&nbsp;she said, "because they are fans of Selena and our music, so it was cool."</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">Suzette Quintanilla Talks Selena Receiving Star on Walk Of Fame</a><p id=eewyjhxv7m7I data-wc=73>It's clear that for Suzette and the rest of her family, the main focus is simply keeping Selena's booming legacy alive. "Anybody that reps it, it's cool,"&nbsp;she said candidly. "It’s just more power. More power to Selena." The icon's legacy has been thriving this year in particular, as Selena has received honors like a Hollywood Walk of Fame star and a MAC cosmetics line inspired by her signature looks, this fall alone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yQcGhqaWNpgHp%2FkWiqnqSVo65uvdSipa2Znp65ra2MrKCsrJWneqy1zGaimqqUlsCptcCnZJ2dnZ56rbvVmquoZZiWua271p6cp2WTpMC1wcyeZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
