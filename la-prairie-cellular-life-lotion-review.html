After falling victim to the allure of a 12-step nightly skin routine a few years back, I've since cut my products down to less than five a night. I'll use prescription retinol and a serum chased by a hefty dose of moisturizer. If I'm feeling fancy, I'll add eye cream. That was the extent of the products stuffed into my TSA-approved plastic bag when I traveled to Grand Cayman with La Prairie last month. I was there to learn about the Platinum Rare Cellular Life-Lotion, the latest extension of the brand's ultra-luxe, platinum-infused anti-aging collection, at the top-rated <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/hotels/caribbean/grand-cayman data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ritz-Carlton spa" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Ritz-Carlton spa</a>.<br></p><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">LA PRAIRIE Platinum Rare Cellular Life-Lotion</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="$765 at Nordstrom for Platinum Rare Cellular Life-Lotion" data-href=https://www.nordstrom.com/s/la-prairie-platinum-rare-cellular-life-lotion/5194514 data-product-url=https://www.nordstrom.com/s/la-prairie-platinum-rare-cellular-life-lotion/5194514 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=1237&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fla-prairie-platinum-rare-cellular-life-lotion%2F5194514&u1=har|xid:{xid}" data-affiliate-network='{"id":"e263d99a-3772-4907-9ae8-cde76366d01b","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","is_active":true,"details":null,"metadata":{"trackonomics":{"merchant_id":"689250","merchant_name":"NORDSTROM.com","network_name":"LS","network_id":"4","product_id":"459","product_name":"Harper&#39;s BAZAAR US","product_external_id":"459","product_url":null}},"network":{"id":"a332915a-6423-480f-9153-e3973f438607","name":"Trackonomics","is_active":true,"business_unit_id":"ad046b46-538b-42cb-aa54-c3d158875ed6","details":"","metadata":{},"created_at":"2021-11-04T18:15:18.481570+00:00","last_updated_at":"2021-11-04T18:15:18.481594+00:00"},"product_metadata":{"115eff3b-95a0-4668-832c-9d02ea92500d":{"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=1237&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fla-prairie-platinum-rare-cellular-life-lotion%2F5194514&u1={subid}","network_name":"ls","appended_link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=1237&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fla-prairie-platinum-rare-cellular-life-lotion%2F5194514&u1={subid}|xid:{xid}","last_updated_at":"2023-10-02 22:15:29.710701"},"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5":{"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=1237&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fla-prairie-platinum-rare-cellular-life-lotion%2F5194514&u1={subid}","network_name":"ls","appended_link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=1237&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fla-prairie-platinum-rare-cellular-life-lotion%2F5194514&u1={subid}|xid:{xid}","last_updated_at":"2023-09-26 23:57:07.441220"}}}' data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$765 at Nordstrom" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nordstrom.com/s/la-prairie-platinum-rare-cellular-life-lotion/5194514 data-vars-ga-product-brand="LA PRAIRIE" data-vars-ga-product-id=2104c623-4eb3-4431-8805-4ceaf4200087 data-vars-ga-product-price=$765.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=a2633a7a-fbea-4d29-aba7-2108f0ea0f80 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="LA PRAIRIE" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category="Burn Care" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-vars-ga-sku=5194514_21773022 data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="Platinum Rare Cellular Life-Lotion" title="Platinum Rare Cellular Life-Lotion" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1549488595-2aa00665-9248-41dc-a8ec-cb89d7ca404d.jpg width=2640 height=4048 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">LA PRAIRIE Platinum Rare Cellular Life-Lotion</h2></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">First, the question on everyone's mind, including my own: what does a pre-serum lotion even do? "A pre-serum lotion serves a similar role to an essence. This light lotion is designed to complement your serum and help deliver an additional layer of active ingredients," says <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.zeichnerdermatology.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dr. Joshua Zeichner" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Dr. Joshua Zeichner</a>, a dermatologist and the director of cosmetic and clinical Research at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. "It may also prime the skin to soften the outer skin layer and enhance penetration of active ingredients applied over it."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Essentially, pre-serum lotions are a watery product that help your actual serums penetrate—and therefore work—better. But the La Prairie Life-Lotion goes one step further, thanks to a new technology that helps your skin's natural cellular detoxification system. This is where things get a little science-y—and explains why the Cellular Life-Lotion costs the same amount as a pair of Jimmy Choos.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Life-Lotion, which took two years to develop, doesn't just hydrate—it also supports the health of the proteosome in your skin's cells. "The proteosome is a complex of enzymes in the skin that eliminate abnormal or damaged proteins. The proteosome is also involved in normal cell growth and turnover," notes Zeichner. Your body's ability to eliminate this cellular junk slows down as you age (just like your body's ability to stay out past 9 p.m.). "If the proteosome is not running optimally, then the cell will not function in as healthy a manner as it should. This ultimately contributes to dull skin, lines, and many other signs of aging," he says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With your skin-detoxing proteosomes firing on all cylinders, and the added protection of a an antioxidant and peptide blend, the Life-Lotion makes the rest of your skincare routine you apply on top work harder. All that skin-boosting technology comes at a price of $655.</p><img alt="Architecture, Light, Property, Lighting, Floor, Stairs, Building, Ceiling, House, Real estate, " title="Architecture, Light, Property, Lighting, Floor, Stairs, Building, Ceiling, House, Real estate, " width=1024 height=745 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rcgc-spa-entrance-waterfalls-1549487772.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">La Prairie</span><p>The entrance to the La Prairie Spa at the Ritz Carlton Grand Cayman.</p><img alt="Interior design, Room, Ceiling, Living room, Furniture, Wall, Lighting, Building, Light fixture, Table, " title="Interior design, Room, Ceiling, Living room, Furniture, Wall, Lighting, Building, Light fixture, Table, " width=1024 height=747 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rcgc-womens-sanctuary-1549487885.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">La Prairie</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I first experienced the pre-serum lotion during the brand's new 90-minute face party called the Ultimate Purifying Platinum Facial, available exclusively at the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/hotels/caribbean/grand-cayman data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ritz-Carlton Grand Cayman" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Ritz-Carlton Grand Cayman</a> resort. As a skincare minimalist, the 14-step treatment was overwhelming to anticipate—but anxiety doesn't exist in the spa's universe. From the futuristic decor of the waiting area, to the fact that your feet are suspended in a warm Epson salt bath during the duration of the facial, the whole experience is so decadent that it's worth pulling money from your savings to book a flight and an appointment. I looked decidedly less puffy when I left thanks to all the lymphatic drainage, and even though I had extractions, I wasn't my typical shade of beet-red or inflamed. I also fell asleep on the table for an undetermined period of time.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Unlike most essences I've tried, which are nothing more than water, the Life-Lotion feels milky and gel-like. The bottle is gorgeous but if we had one complaint, it's this: it's downright awkward to pour in into your palm (we wish there was an eyedropper applicator). At $655 a bottle, you don't want to risk spilling a single proteosome-sized drop—so tread lightly. But once you pat it on, the gel melts away, revealing skin that looks instantly a little more luminous (that's the platinum).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I've been using it for a few weeks without any irritation—even when coupled with my hardcore retinol. Is my skin better off for it? Honestly, it does look a little more plump and dewy than it normally would after a brutal winter. And I just like knowing that it's making all my other hard-earned skincare products work harder, too.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a5b794e4-ba0e-4527-9e9d-e98142b9fbef_1526586861.jpg alt="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" title="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Jenna Rosenstein is the Beauty Director at Harper's BAZAAR across both print and digital.
