From time to time, he would even play it at live shows as a gag, and it's clear that not only his voice was used from 1986 to 1990. His skillful guitar playing helped make the song popular, as well. That was back in a day of great sitcom theme songs, when a full 60 seconds would be dedicated to set the stage for every episode, and real men wore stonewashed blue jeans.</p><p><strong>Listen to Steve Wariner Sing the 'Who's the Boss?' Theme</strong></p><p>Eight seasons of Who's the Boss? aired on ABC from 1984 to 1992, but the show's stars Tony Danza and Alyssa Milano confirm that a revival is in the works in 2020. Credit Deadline Hollywood with the scoop, but both actors took to social media to&nbsp;validate, with Danza sharing some vintage imagery from the show:</p><p>This new series does not have a network home and is being billed as a sequel to the original. Milano's Samantha Micelli is now a single mother living in the same home the series was set in originally. Danza played her father, and the pair lived with Judith Light's Angela, with the leading male playing her housekeeper.</p><p>Light and Danny Pintauro (Angela's son Jonathan) were not announced as part of this new series. They're said to be supportive of the show, however, and their characters may be involved at some point. Series favorite Katherine Helmond (Angela's mother Mona) died in 2019. At its peak,&nbsp;Who's the Boss? pulled 33 million viewers weekly.</p><p>Wariner would go on to become a '90s country hitmakers with a string of hits including "Holes&nbsp;in the Floor of Heaven" and "Two Teardrops."</p><p><strong>'80s Country Fans Need to Know These Songs:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmq52dmrqjsdFmrqGhk516pLvUp6ursV2otq%2BzxKtkrJmenHq4tM6sZK2glWKvsL%2FSZquhnZ2aerS7zaBm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
