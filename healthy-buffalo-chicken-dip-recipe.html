Buffalo chicken dip in particular is easy to whip up and bakes in just 20 minutes. What you end up with is a dip that’s creamy, tangy and spicy all in one. It’s also simple to put a nutritious spin on this starter by adding a surprise ingredient: canned white beans. This pantry staple gives the dip a nice dose of protein and fiber, making it nourishing. Plus, the beans’ plain flavor pairs well with the boldness of other ingredients in the dish like Buffalo wing sauce and garlic powder. Keep reading to learn more about making a healthy version of buffalo chicken dip that will be the star of the appetizer table!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Buffalo chicken dip?</h2><p>This dip is made by mixing together cooked chicken, Buffalo wing sauce, cream cheese, seasonings and shredded cheese. Next, the mixture gets placed into a dish, topped with extra cheese and baked until it’s warm and golden brown. You’ll find that the dip tastes spicy like actual Buffalo wings, but it has an added zesty and creamy flavor thanks to the cheeses and seasonings. In addition to being full of yummy goodness, this dip is filling and nutritious when you add canned beans to the base.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A nutritionist’s secret to lighter Buffalo chicken dip</h2><p>White beans such as cannellini beans are buttery and brimming with nutrients. “Not only do these beans increase the protein content of this dip, but they also provide a great source of fiber for ultimate satiety,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brittany Placencia, nutritionist and founder at Simple Plate Nutrition</a> says. A ½ cup serving of cannellini beans contains <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">8 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber</a>. Since these nutrients keep you fuller longer, you’ll feel satisfied within the first portion of this dip. (Though, you won’t feel too stuffed to go back for seconds.) The best part about adding beans to the dip? You can “hide” them in the mixture with a simple step!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Easy trick for adding the beans to the appetizer</h2><p>Before adding the beans to the dip mixture, Placencia bends them with a small amount of water. This breaks up the beans so they form a smooth paste that’s easy to incorporate with the other ingredients. Blending the beans also helps form a velvety consistency within the dip, making them barely noticeable as you’re serving and enjoying it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A healthy Buffalo chicken dip recipe</h2><p>Below, you can find Placencia’s Buffalo Chicken Dip recipe — which is lighter but just as delicious as the classic version. You can adjust the amounts of Buffalo sauce and garlic powder to your liking, and then serve the snack with your favorite dippers!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Healthy Buffalo Chicken Dip</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/Homemade-buffalo-chicken-dip.jpg><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>2 cups cooked chicken, chopped or shredded</li><li>1 (15 oz.) can white beans, drained and rinsed</li><li>1 (8oz.) block of cream cheese, room temperature</li><li>½ cup Buffalo wing sauce&nbsp;(any spice level)</li><li>⅔ cup Greek yogurt&nbsp;</li><li>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese&nbsp;+ additional</li><li>½ cup shredded cheddar cheese&nbsp;+ additional</li><li>2 Tbs. regular or roasted garlic powder &nbsp;</li><li>⅓ cup chopped green onions + additional for garnish</li><li>Pinch of salt and pepper</li><li>Olive or avocado oil cooking spray</li></ul><p><strong>Directions:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Yield:</strong> 6 servings</li></ul><li>Preheat oven to 400°F.
