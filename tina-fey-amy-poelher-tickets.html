Because we kind of trained at the same places and work the same way it’s so easy,” she said. She continued, “We share a very similar vocabulary – especially when you’re about to go do the Golden Globes or about to do live television for the first time or you’re trying something new it feels really good to have somebody who knows your timing [and] your rhythm.”</p><p>Fey and Poelher also looked back at their friendship in a 2015 interview with Glamour. “We don’t see each other very often,” Fey said at the time. Poelher added, “That’s right. It’s like a good marriage. My mom always says it’s very important to have people in your life who knew you when. The older you get, the more you treasure that idea of someone knowing your family and where you came from, and being around during these times and these times.” Poelher also joked that neither she nor Fey have sisters and they’ve instead “rented them.” “We found sisters,” Fey corrected Poelher.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Tina Fey and Amy Poelher tickets to the Restless Leg Tour are available on <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2>StubHub</span></a> and <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2>Vivid Seats</span></a>.

The new York Times bestseller takes readers through Fey’s life and career before she made a name for herself as Liz Lemon on 30 Rock or the anchor of Saturday Night Lie’s “Weekend Anchor.” Consisting of laugh-out-loud autobiographical essays, Bossypants—which the Sunday Telegraph described as “a masterpiece”—sees Fey tell readers intimate stories from her childhood and adult life, from the time she was chased through a local airport by her middle-school gym teacher to the dream that she would one day become a fanous comedian.</p><p>“From her youthful days as a vicious nerd to her tour of duty on Saturday Night Live; from her passionately halfhearted pursuit of physical beauty to her life as a mother eating things off the floor; from her one-sided college romance to her nearly fatal honeymoon—from the beginning of this paragraph to this final sentence,” the publisher’s description reads. “Tina Fey reveals all, and proves what we’ve always suspected: you’re no one until someone calls you bossy.”</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
