For women over 50, although their relationship with fashion evolves, jeans remain a reliable choice. Unlike the younger generations, whose tastes often are influenced by social media and what celebrities are wearing, the more experienced generation favor classic cuts and more sophisticated styles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Most women, once they hit 50, gain extra weight around the middle during menopause so there are several things to think about their newer bodies,” says stylist Michelle Barrett. “Look for a medium waist with a straight leg. A medium waist will cover that lower tummy area many women are not comfortable with.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are of course other flattering silhouettes such as high-waisted or bootcut jeans. We spoke to celebrity stylists, fashion experts and tested out pairs ourselves to find the best jeans for women over 50. We looked for wide size ranges, comfortable yet supportive materials, and silhouettes and washes that make you feel confident at any age.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-gloria-vanderbilt-womens-petite-classic-amanda-high-rise-tapered-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Gloria Vanderbilt Women's Petite Classic Amanda High Rise Tapered Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Gloria Vanderbilt Women's Petite Classic Amanda High Rise Tapered Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/9NxqPPIRlwkHOBAN0VwH6zSjgh0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/gloria-vanderbilt-womens-petite-classic-amanda-high-rise-tapered-jean-bbe62db2409c44529964d01156564d4b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>There’s standard, petite, and plus-size options available.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The sizing can be inconsistent between washes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Look no further for the ultimate pair of jeans — Gloria Vanderbilt has designed this collection with a range of women in mind. This Amazon favorite boasts an impressive 78,000 reviews, catering to every woman's needs, be it standard, petite, or plus size. This classic high-rise taper jean embodies comfort and style, complete with functional pockets, an easy zipper fly, and over 60 different washes to pick from. In fact, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Priyanka Chopra</a> says she can spend all day in these jeans and feel comfortable. Plus, a pair is only $12, so at this price range can you really only buy just one?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Hitting right at your natural waistline, these jeans don’t cut into your middle and extra support helps smooth your middle. Not too high waisted or too low, versatility reigns supreme as these jeans effortlessly pair with a spectrum of tops, from chic fashion pieces to casual tees, and look good with various footwear choices. Due to all the different washes, some reviewers say the sizing is inconsistent between colors, so you may want to order a couple options and use Amazon’s great return policy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>2-26 |<strong> Material:</strong> Cotton, Spandex<strong> </strong>|<strong> Inseam: </strong>31-inch | <strong>Wash: </strong>64<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-lee-womens-instantly-slims-classic-relaxed-fit-monroe-straight-leg-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lee Women's Instantly Slims Classic Relaxed Fit Monroe Straight Leg Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lee Women's Instantly Slims Classic Relaxed Fit Monroe Straight Leg Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/lN0RsRmT0Y5OVn-NKePGE0CWKyw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lee-womens-instantly-slims-classic-relaxed-fit-monroe-straight-leg-jean-260ef30976ee41e0833948c9a9992139.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The fabric sculpts your curves and doesn't sag.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Due to the sculpting nature, these jeans tend to run small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Lee, a renowned denim brand with a rich history since 1889, remains timeless for women of all ages and sizes. This pair is especially popular. Labeled as a relaxed fit, these high-waisted jeans skim your body so that they are comfortable without being too baggy. Robust stretch fabric not only ensures flexibility but also contributes to a sculpting effect on the silhouette. Plus, these jeans provide a supportive fit, so they won’t sag when you wear them hours on end. Since these jeans offer some sculpting, they tend to run small, so consider sizing up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>2-26 |<strong> Material: </strong>Cotton<strong> </strong>|<strong> Inseam: </strong>29-inch | <strong>Wash:&nbsp;</strong>5</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-still-here-nyc-tate-original-crop-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Still Here NYC Tate Original Crop Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Still Here NYC Tate Original Crop Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/-q6feXFFpD3HKFj6bxk-xaCK5Q0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/still-here-nyc-tate-jeans-eff2d79f701c488ab22e8074d353b413.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bergdorf Goodman</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s the perfect everyday jean that is easy to style.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> You have to line dry these jeans.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When I showed my mom (who is 57) this pair of jeans, she was ready to whip out her credit card and buy herself a pair. Working in a hospital, my mom needs a pair of pants that will allow her to be mobile in her workplace but dress with poise. These jeans allowed her to move around with ease, thanks to the cropped leg and cotton makeup. Plus, the high rise and tapered leg go with so many tops and shoes, making getting dressed that much easier. Because they are made from 100 percent cotton, these jeans don’t belong in the dryer, unless you want them to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>shrink</a>. With a $200+ price tag, sure this pair is a splurge, but we love how it’s available in so many different colors and a universal fit for that “everyday” jean look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>22-32 |<strong> Material: </strong>Cotton<strong>&nbsp;</strong>|<strong> Inseam:&nbsp; </strong>29-inch |&nbsp; <strong>Wash: </strong>7</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-straight-good-american-good-straight-leg-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Straight</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Good American Good Straight-Leg Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Good American Good Straight-Leg Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/_uDl_MjVKhk0CmyaVe8Ng6VxoRk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/good-american-good-straight-leg-jeans-b75774b0e90c498d94f19782254d0e2c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Good American</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This straight leg jean lifts your backside without gapping.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The shorter inseam can fall short on tall folks.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Many celebrities including Chrissy Teigen, Ashley Graham, and Kelly Rowland are all obsessed with Good American clothing, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>and so are we</a>. Everyone needs a good straight leg jean, and this pair goes above and beyond by sculpting your legs and enhancing your booty thanks to a deep yoke. With a high amount of stretch, these jeans are not only comfortable but also offer great retention so that they maintain their curve-hugging shape all day — making them a good option for those in search of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>jeans for curvy women</a>. We also love how they feature a gap-proof waistband, which is especially helpful for anyone with wider hips. Though petite frames will be a fan of the cropped length, this style may be too short for those who are tall.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>00-30 |<strong> Material: </strong>Cotton, polyester, elastane<strong>&nbsp;</strong>|<strong> Inseam: </strong>27.5-inch | <strong>Wash: </strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-democracy-absolution-bootcut-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Democracy "Ab"solution Bootcut Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Democracy &amp;quot;Ab&amp;quot;solution Bootcut Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/m-ChEdt0hbumC75Nc6hB10cAPJw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/democracy-absolution-bootcut-jeans-d74ed0273bb24a6a958fafa28edfda35.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Democracy</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These black jeans sculpt your abs and booty.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Some colors might bleed in the wash.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Thanks to the “Ab"solution fit technology inside all of their jeans, these jeans smooth and support your tummy. There’s a no-gap elastic that conforms to each wearer’s waist and prevents gapping in the back. Plus, the slightly arched back yoke creates the illusion of a lifted and round booty. Coming in black, this bootcut jean will soon become your wardrobe staple, as it works with a wide range of footwear and tops. Due to the deep shade, the jeans might bleed in the first wash, so be sure to wash it with other black fabrics.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>14-24 |<strong> Material: </strong>Cotton, spandex<strong> </strong>|<strong> Inseam: </strong>32-inch | <strong>Wash:&nbsp;</strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-petite-mott--bow-slim-boyfriend-allen-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Petite</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Mott & Bow Slim Boyfriend Allen Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Mott &amp;amp; Bow Slim Boyfriend Allen Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/4GkQWThl1PIjlns7GUO5Oc2jCDI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mott-bow-slim-boyfriend-allen-jeans-689e406341d94884a0fef00ff7b60a09.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Mott & Bow&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>With a shorter inseam and comfortable fit, these jeans are a must for petite figures.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Some colors might bleed in the wash.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As a petite woman, I worry about finding jeans that aren’t too long for me or where the material doesn’t bunch at the bottom of my ankles. In other words, I need <a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>petite jeans</a> designed for smaller frames. Thanks to this pair by Mott & Bow, which comes in three different inseam lengths, all petite women can take a deep breath of relief. These slim boyfriend jeans finish well above your ankles which is ideal to pair with boots or comfortable white sneakers. The extra comfort and elasticity of the jeans allow for flexibility, so I prefer wearing them when running my weekend errands or going for brunch.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike the traditional <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>boyfriend jeans</a>, this fit is not too baggy for anyone who prefers more fitted clothing. Just in case you want a slightly worn-in look, opt for the gray wash and style with a neutral color for a clean, yet minimalistic look. These darker shades can bleed when washing, so only throw them in with similar colors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>24-32 |<strong> Material: </strong>Cotton, polyester and elastane<strong> </strong>|<strong> Inseam: </strong>28, 30, and 32-inch | <strong>Wash: </strong>1<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tall-1822-denim-extra-long-butter-skinny-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Tall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>1822 Denim Extra Long Butter Skinny Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="1822 Denim Extra Long Butter Skinny Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/WkgdIw-UmF20mfaMNqjscLhPEME=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/1822-denim-extra-long-butter-skinny-jeans-2acf347299cb43909f7126c7ec1679ad.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Finally, a skinny jean long enough for tall limbs.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They can run large, so consider sizing down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Just like those who are petite struggle with jeans being too short, people with long legs often can’t find <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>jeans that work for tall women</a>. Thankfully, 1822 makes their buttery soft skinnies with an extra long, 34-inch inseam. With a timeless indigo wash, flattering mid-rise, and elongating stretch, these jeans can work both in the office and on the weekends. A perfect match for women in their 50s, they effortlessly complement a crisp white shirt and boots or chic closed heels, creating a sophisticated ensemble that speaks volumes. Even tall reviewers say they run large, so consider sizing down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>24-33 |<strong> Material: </strong>Cotton, polyester and spandex<strong> </strong>|<strong> Inseam: </strong>34-inch | <strong>Wash:&nbsp;</strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-curvy-everlane-the-curvy-90s-cheeky-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Curvy</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Everlane The Curvy ’90s Cheeky Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Everlane The Curvy &amp;rsquo;90s Cheeky Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/SLIQhP_mQCP1hN2xoJVLeue0zvY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/everlane-the-curvy-90s-cheeky-jean-26bade3125b0462f93e51ce2c9dbe61d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Everlane&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This style actually fits your waist and hips correctly.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> These jeans don’t have stretch, so you’ll have to break them in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For curvy women, one of the most frustrating aspects about finding the perfect pair of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>jeans for rounder bellies</a> is finding something that fits your hips and waist without a waist gap. Another issue is finding <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>jeans for thicker thighs</a>. Now enter Everlane’s Curvy Cheeky Jeans. Tailored for hourglass figures, it flaunts an extra-high rise, flattering straight leg, and booty-enhancing fit. The best part is that the hip to waist ratio creates a snug hip-thigh fit that is crafted from premium non-stretch Japanese denim. Made from 100 percent organic cotton, these jeans don’t have any stretch, so you’ll likely have to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>break them in</a> at first. It’s the perfect throwback to the ‘90s, which I’m sure any woman in her 50s will appreciate the vintage inspiration.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>23-33 |<strong> Material: </strong>Organic<strong> </strong>Cotton<strong> </strong>| <strong>Inseam: </strong>26.5 or 28.5-inch | <strong>Wash: </strong>4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cropped-etica-tyler-straight-crop-torrent></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cropped</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Etica Tyler Straight Crop Torrent</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Etica Tyler Straight Crop Torrent" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/YrM2nEcLYHcDPbTSDUS-BVF5wKw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/etica-tyler-straight-crop-torrent-cb3e63569bc8443d98dc9f3df0657b82.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Etica</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These<strong> </strong>jeans are made with social responsibility in mind.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> We wish there were more washes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Making sustainable fashion choices is not only important, but vital in today’s fast fashion world.

The best thing about these jeans is that they are so versatile, and effortlessly suit vacations, summer, or autumn outings.

Thanks to a trusted tummy-smoothing panel and a well-crafted bootleg cut, your legs also enjoy a flattering elongation – a true win-win scenario.

With such a small amount of spandex included, this pair has just enough to ensure a comfortable fit, while maintaining that rigid denim look. What we really admire about this pair is that has an overall fitted shape with just a touch of slouch. These mid-rise jeans also have a gap-proof contoured waist and shaping panels that subtly sculpt any figure. Those who are shorter may want to avoid this cropped cut, as the capri length can make them look even shorter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>00-16 |<strong> Material: </strong>Cotton, elasterell and spandex<strong>&nbsp;</strong>|<strong> Inseam: </strong>28.5-inch | <strong>Wash: </strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-high-waisted-na-kd-mom-high-waist-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best High-Waisted</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Na-kd Mom High Waist Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Na-kd Mom High Waist Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/uXoofmSIuKM69dpnku50hy30OZs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/na-kd-mom-high-waist-jeans-29659c9f6fe44a5e9f63f4033d74333a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Na-kd&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These jeans are timeless.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Sizes tend to sell out.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Elevate your style with Swedish brand Na-KD's high waist mom jeans, a perfect choice for women seeking comfort and style. These stretchy jeans offer a flattering high waist, accentuating your silhouette. With a five-pocket design and raw details, they exude an effortless chic and are available in three versatile washes. Personally, I love how giftable this pair is and would make a great present for the upcoming holiday season because they will last a long time in someone’s wardrobe. Plus, Na-KD aspires to embrace sustainability and by 2030 is aiming to utilize 100 percent organic, recycled or other low-impact materials in all their products to create a more conscious fashion future. Because of how popular the brand is, sizes tend to sell out, so don’t sleep on this one.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size range: </strong>EU 32-42 |<strong> Material: </strong>Cotton, polyester and elastane<strong>&nbsp;</strong>|<strong> Inseam: </strong>27-inch | <strong>Wash:&nbsp;</strong>3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-black-the-daria-jean-better-than-denim></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Black</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>The Daria Jean Better Than Denim</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="The Daria Jean Better Than Denim" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/4RFfiyY52WwpN13X5gqIIOf_mrg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/the-daria-jean-better-than-denim-d93fd5624ce94db6a7ff806ebb9bcd39.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>M.M.Lafleur</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The black doesn’t fade when washing.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> We wish it came in more colors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">I fell in love with this pair of black jeans the second I put them on.

Fashion stylist Liz Wendler recommends washing jeans before wearing to help remove any dye left from production to avoid staining anything white, like your sneakers or couch. Be sure to turn them inside out and wash cold and then hang dry them until they are fully dry. After which, put them in the dryer for no more than 10 minutes to soften the stiffness of the denim and avoid washing after every wear.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fit</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although many brands like Measure & Made and Good American are actively trying to fix challenges in achieving uniform sizing and accessibility, there is still more work to be done.
