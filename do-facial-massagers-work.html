But in the real, non-celebrity world, a standing appointment with a pricy, massage-trained facialist isn’t always in the cards, nor is the time, patience, or knack for following instructions required for giving yourself a thorough DIY version (as in, rubbing your own face with your own hands for twenty minutes at a time).</p><p>This is where the handheld <a href=# rel=noopener>facial massager</a> comes in. The selling point is rather appealing: You can forget about expensive facials or having to figure out exactly where to place your fingertips on the part of your jaw where your lymph nodes are to get maximum drainage of, well, whatever’s under your skin.</p><p>The good news is that with the addition of these types of tools to the market, you, too, can now get a <a href=# rel=noopener>facial massage</a> from the comfort of your desk, where you’ve been stagnating for the past nine hours. But should we all be rushing to get our hands on them in the pursuit of smoother, clearer, younger-looking skin? Maybe not so much. “There really isn’t much solid data to indicate that <a href=# id=auto-tag_facial-massagers data-tag=facial-massagers>facial massagers</a> offer any significant benefits to the skin,” says Dr. Julia Tzu, the founder and Medical Director of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Wall Street Dermatology</a>. “Massaging the face, in general, may help stimulate circulation, [especially] in the morning, to help speed up the resolution of the ‘puffy’ look that some people get when they wake up.” Still, Dr. Tzu notes, “This is often already performed when one washes the face.”</p><p>The placebo effect, however, is alive and well, which is to say that facial-massaging tools feel great and are therefore not purely B.S. If you believe in them, and want to see a difference, your brain might just be kind enough to trick you into thinking you do. Regardless, celebrities and customers of the below devices swear by them, so why not give one of them a shot yourself?</p><p class=p1><i>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
