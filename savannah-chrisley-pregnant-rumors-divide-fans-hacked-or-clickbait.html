It’s safe to say, Savannah has not shared any pregnancy news.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-savannah-s-post-is-clickbait>Savannah’s post is ‘clickbait’</h2><p>Following the upload and deletion of the pregnancy post on Savannah’s Facebook page, a Reddit user screenshotted it and shared it in a Reddit thread.</p><p>Commenters on the thread said the star’s post was “clickbait” as the link included in the post “takes you to an article of like celebrities in 2023 that announced their legitimate pregnancies…”</p><p>The commenter added: “…so it’s just literal clickbait…”</p><p>It could have been a hacker’s way of getting people to click on that article.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-hacked-vs-desperate-claims>‘Hacked’ vs ‘desperate’ claims</h2><p>While many of the Reddit users commented that Savannah’s pregnancy post seemed “desperate,” others suggested she may have been “hacked.”</p><p>One person commented: “The desperation is deafening…”</p><p>Another defended the <a href=#>reality TV</a> star, however, commenting: “I think her Facebook got hacked. I genuinely do, It’s been posting weird things.”</p><p>Some similar posts on Savannah’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Facebook page</a> including one that suggests her parents got “divorced” are still live. One from June 16 reads “official divorce statement,” despite Todd and Julie Chrisley still being together.</p><p>It’s unclear whether Savannah shares the posts herself or if she had been hacked with her ‘pregnancy’ announcement.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfo7K4v46smK%2BZnqOuqXnCoamiq5yaxm680Z6ep5meqXqzwcyoqaxllJ7DqrDEZp2apqNitaKvyp6bZqeiYrCttcKkmZqhpA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
