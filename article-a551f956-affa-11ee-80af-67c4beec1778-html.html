She made her initial appearance in Jones County Justice Court last week in front of Judge Grant Hedgepeth and has since been released on $75,000 bond. She was also charged with DUI-first offense after the incident near her home.</p><p>Deputies from the Jones County Sheriff’s Department were dispatched to a call of an “assault with multiple parties” on Pineview Lane, just east of Glade-Paulding Road, at 11:30 p.m. on Dec. 31. Tanner Parker and his new bride were there at a private residence celebrating their wedding when the host was reportedly beaten up by four people who were “uninvited” but at a nearby residence.</p><p>That’s when Green arrived and began “screaming and fired four or five shots from a firearm in the direction of Mr. Parker and others at this party” and two of the people began beating another party host “with their hands and/or fists” after he fell to the ground.</p><p>When one of the guests went to help the host and was holding the assailant, Green “pointed a handgun at a his head and pulled the trigger on an empty chamber while stating, ‘I will kill you,’” then pulled the trigger again after the man she was pointing the weapon at pushed it away, according to the report. Green then turned the weapon toward a woman and pulled the trigger again on an empty chamber and said, “This is what the safety is for,” the report continued.</p><p>The uninvited group then left as the party-goers called 911 and Green left in her white Mercedes “at a high rate of speed,” but she returned when a deputy and EMServ Ambulance arrived. Deputy Davy Keith had his weapon drawn and ordered Green to get out of her Mercedes with her hands up and Deputy Brandon Gregory removed her from the vehicle. A chrome Smith & Wesson .38-caliber revolver and “several spent shell casings” were in the driver’s seat of the Mercedes, according to the report, and Green was “visibly intoxicated.” It was noted that she had trouble standing and walking and she kept repeating that she “only wanted her housecoat” as she was hyperventilating.</p><p>She reportedly resisted getting in the back of Deputy Jarone Walker’s cruiser and made repeated racial epithets, screaming that she was not going to listen to the “n - - - - r music” that was playing on the black deputy’s stereo at the time. She had a blood-alcohol level of .166 — more than twice the legal limit of .08 — on a portable breathalyzer but refused to take the test on the Intoxilyzer 8000 at the jail. She was charged with DUI-refusal along with aggravated assault when she was booked into the Jones County Adult Detention Center.</p><p>Lawrence Green, 45, came to the jail and was charged with simple assault in the incident, according to the report.</p><p>The spat between neighbors started about two weeks earlier, when the party host was accused of killing the Greens’ cat, which the hosts denied doing, according to the report.</p><p>The Leader-Call had been requesting reports and/or information on the incident for more than a week and received the report on Wednesday morning. There has been a shift in responsibilities within the department and everyone is getting accustomed to their new roles, JCSD leaders explained. The JCSD has a new person in charge of handling media requests for information, Lt. Stephen Graeser of the Criminal Investigation Division, after Sgt. J.D. Carter was promoted to lieutenant over the Patrol Division.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwstGenJimlazAcMPIpZtmr5WZsaq6xmiYq6yZmLmmq8BubGqeaWqDbq3Fn5hmaWGasm6Ej5qdZm5nmIGjscScaHBvaGO1tbnL</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
