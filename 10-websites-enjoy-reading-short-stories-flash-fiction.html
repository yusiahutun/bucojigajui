It has the aim of publishing work that is “intelligent and unpretentious” while simultaneously promoting new authors and highlighting discussion around how stories can help to further causes such as social justice and alternative cultures.</p><p>The stories on the site are all available for free, with the site relying on donations to stay online. You will find stories, essays, discussion pieces, content from literary magazines, and more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Make sure you also check out the recommended reading archive.

It publishes a single piece of flash fiction every day.</p><p>Not sure what flash fiction is? Here is how the site's founder, Kathy Kachelries, describes it:</p><p>"Flash fiction is fiction with its teeth bared and its claws extended, lithe, and muscular with no extra fat. It pounces in the first paragraph, and if those claws aren’t embedded in the reader by the start of the second, the story began a paragraph too soon. There is no margin for error. Every word must be essential, and if it isn’t essential, it must be eliminated."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most of the stories are in the science fiction category, and all are under 600 words. All the work on the site is published under a Creative Commons license, meaning that if you are a writer, you are free to pick the story up and add to it and develop it further.</p><h2 id=east-of-the-web>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">East of the Web</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/east-of-the-web.png><p>The content on East of the Web is divided into three categories: Short Stories, Word Games, and Interactive Stories.
