'Sister Wives' fans are wondering if they should start reading between the lines of the season 17 tell-all episode. What isn't being said seems pretty important.

In years past, the tell-all episodes allowed for big revelations and the airing of grievances that feel especially cathartic after a season of confusing and complicated family dynamics."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In years past, the tell-all episodes allowed for <a href=#>big revelations</a> and the airing of grievances that feel especially cathartic after a season of confusing and complicated family dynamics. The season 17 tell-all episode is hitting differently, and it’s not a good thing. Viewers are largely unsatisfied, and the entire spectacle has been a bit strange. The strangest thing, though, is not what is being said but rather what is not being said.&nbsp;</p><h2>Kody Brown refuses to discuss his relationship with Robyn Brown in the latest ‘Sister Wives’ tell-all episode &nbsp;</h2><p id=par-2_46>Part 2 of the&nbsp;Sister Wives&nbsp;tell-all episode aired on Jan. 1. As the first episode in the new year, fans had high hopes that host <a href=#>Sukanya Krishnan</a> would ask some hard-hitting questions. While she tried to coax Kody into answering some important questions, he was not interested.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/TLC-Robyn-and-Kody-wedding.png><p id=par-3_54>Kody, oddly enough, refused to so much as utter Robyn’s name for the majority of the episode. Instead, he danced around questions about her and evaded any suggestion that he treated <a href=#>Robyn Brown </a>differently than his other wives. Robyn has also been particularly reserved in this year’s tell-all episodes. So, what could be happening?&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-could-kody-and-robyn-be-on-the-rocks-too>Could Kody and Robyn be on the rocks, too?&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-4_42>Kody’s absolute refusal to speak about Robyn has viewers confused. While some fans argue that Kody fears talking about Robyn because he doesn’t want to confirm that <a href=#>he plays favorites </a>with his wives. While that’s entirely possible, there is an alternate theory.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p id=par-5_78>Is it possible that <a href=#>Kody and Robyn’s marriage</a> is on the rocks, too? It would stand to reason that Kody wouldn’t want to talk about Robyn and their relationship if that one failed. After all, he spent the last two years insisting that Robyn was the only person who understood him. It certainly would be embarrassing to admit that, perhaps, that wasn’t the case. It would also be uncomfortable to accept yet another one of his marriages failed.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p id=par-6_64>A rift with his last remaining wife could also explain some of the aggression Kody has displayed during the most recent tell-all episode. If that were true, though, what would it mean for&nbsp;Sister Wives?&nbsp;Would the show end, or would <a href=#>TLC </a>continue to document the Brown family’s downfall? It looks like the show will continue for at least another season, so only time will tell.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_22>The final part of the season 17 tell-all episode will air on Jan. 8. All&nbsp;Sister Wives&nbsp;episodes are available for streaming on discovery+.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMrKurmZ6csrTAjK2foqaXYq6ju9StZKyho6mys3nWoq2eq12psq24jJqjpWWVpba0u8OeZLCgkal6uK3Sp6tmq5GesW%2B006ajaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
