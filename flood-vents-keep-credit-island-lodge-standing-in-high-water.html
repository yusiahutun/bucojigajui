They traded. They bartered,” Tubbs said. “There’s just a lot of history there and there’s some value to retaining historical facilities.”</p><p>After the floodwaters recede, crew members will powerwash the lodge and sanitize it. However, Tubbs said she doesn’t know when that will be.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46fo6inlGLDprrTrGSknZWleqS%2BxJ2grWWZqLmiusNmo6icl5p6tMDAp5uippditq95x6KeoWWnlsGmvo4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
