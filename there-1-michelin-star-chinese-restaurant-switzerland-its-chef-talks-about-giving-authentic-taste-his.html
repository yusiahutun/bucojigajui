I was used to doing things in a different way,” says Xu through an interpreter. “But I just worked hard, and stayed motivated. I was ambitious and wanted to succeed.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Xu’s ambitions built on a legacy started by his grandfather and continued by his father, who were both chefs.

The hotel fascinated young Xu, who would sneak in and watch his dad at work: “Even when I was small, I liked cooking. I enjoyed it much more than school,” he says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/15/e80df40e-50c9-4c72-9e5c-03d98374b769_cd65c64b.jpg>His father later opened his own restaurant, this time a private kitchen for events such as weddings and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Lunar New Year</span></a> celebrations.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Xu left school in 1981, aged 13, and joined his father in the banqueting business.
