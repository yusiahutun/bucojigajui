He left unmentioned the businesses that have left Rock Island over the past year, including:</p><ul><li>Blue Cat Brew Pub closed as of Jan. 1, 2023.</li><li>Rock Island Brewing Company (RIBCO) closed in December 2023.</li><li>Sound Conservatory moved from downtown Rock Island to downtown Moline in November 2023.</li><li>The Artsy Bookworm on 30th Street is planning to close its brick-and-mortar store after Jan. 27 and focus on online and off-site events.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/01/DowntownRI2.png><p>The city hopes to break ground this spring on a long-planned $7.4 million Rebuild Downtown Rock Island streetscaping project. Construction will include new water infrastructure, a gateway entrance facing Schwiebert Park, a mini roundabout for improved traffic flow, wider sidewalks for pedestrians and cafe seating, new lighting and public art.</p><p>The new $40-million new federal courthouse (320 18th&nbsp;St.) is now expected to be done by the end of 2024, if not early next year, but while serving as new home for the U.S. Central District of Illinois, the building is privately owned and will be leased to government agencies, Thoms said.</p><p>“It will be on the tax rolls and will bring a lot of high-paying jobs to downtown Rock Island,” he said. The three-story, 53,356-square-foot building (across 4th&nbsp;Avenue from the long vacant former Rock Island Argus building) will house the U.S. District Court and several other federal agencies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/07/New-YWCA-1.jpg><p>The new $20-million YWCA is nearing completion at 5th Avenue and 17th Street, to open by March, the mayor said. That is a two-story, 48,900-square-foot building that had its groundbreaking in fall 2021.</p><p>Six new street projects are planned this year, for a total investment of $11 million, Thoms said. Among public works projects done last year were the 11th Street water main replacement; reconstruction of 37th and 46th streets; a 28th Street storm sewer upgrade between 18th and 19th avenues, and a new downtown public parking lot (replacing the former parking garage), which holds 230 vehicles and has four electric vehicle charging stations.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Pickleball, tennis and more</strong></p><p>Thoms sang the praises of improvements to city parks and recreation facilities, both in 2023 and to come this year.</p><p>Lighting was completed at Douglas Park ball fields, with help of $70,000 raised by the Friends of Douglas Park. In recent years, more than $2 million in private and public funds has been invested in the park.</p><p>RIFAC (the Rock Island Fitness and Activity Center) is in the midst of a large remodeling project that includes men’s and women’s locker rooms with new lockers, flooring, a new steam room and sauna, and installation of new windows in the pool area.</p><p>Denkmann Park had a complete makeover with installation of ADA-accessible sidewalks, a new concrete basketball court and hoops, and rehab of the picnic shelter and playground.</p><p>A new 3,000-square-foot clubhouse was built at Highland Springs Golf Course with a First Tee classroom, outdoor patio and ADA parking and pathways.</p><p>Renovations of the Carriage House at the Hauberg Estate were completed, including new ADA restrooms, all new windows, doors, glass storefront with breezeway, and a bar and event space.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/01/Saukie9.png><p>The award of a nearly $1 million state grant will pay for construction of a new clubhouse at Saukie Golf Course, replacing the original 95-year-old clubhouse.</p><p>Six new tennis courts with pickleball striping were constructed at Lincoln Park that will serve as the home of Augustana College tennis teams, Alleman High School tennis and for the community – a project funded by Augustana.</p><p>And six pickleball courts were constructed at Mel McKay Park with federal ARPA funding and an OSLAD grant from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. Fencing, seating and parking areas were also installed. “The fastest growing sport in America has a new home in Rock Island,” Thoms said.</p><p><strong>Police, fire and library</strong></p><p>The city Police Department added 12 new officers to the force in 2023, including five female officers, bringing the total number of female officers on the 80-plus officer force to 11. That’s the highest number of female officers in the Police Department’s history, Thoms said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/01/RI-police2.png><p>In 2023, the number of violent gun crimes dropped 25% and the number of seized firearms increased by 20%, he said. With city council support using ARPA funding, the Police Department implemented an Automated License Plate Reader System, which is part of a network used by several law enforcement agencies in Rock Island and Scott counties.</p><p>Additional cameras were installed at intersections around the city. The Police Department worked with the Rock Island-Milan School District to bring a School Resource Officer back to the high school starting in 2024.</p><p>The Fire Department had a very busy year with 7,837 calls for service. Of those calls, 174 were fires; 5,839 were emergency medical service calls; 770 service calls; and one tornado. Personnel also assisted 120 child caregivers with car seat installations and education sessions, Thoms said.</p><p>Two new fire engines were purchased and will arrive soon.</p><p>The Rock Island Public Library (the first public library to open in the state of Illinois) marked its 150th anniversary in 2023 and also celebrated the 120th anniversary of the downtown branch on 19th Street.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/01/WattsMidtown.png><p>The city opened its third library location — the Watts-Midtown Branch on 30th Street (the former Tri-City Jewish Center) by celebrating with a ribbon tying ceremony in February. More than 700 visitors came to opening day March 11. This shared facility with the Two Rivers YMCA is one of only a handful of library/YMCA combos in the nation, Thoms said.</p><p>In 2023, the library partnered with more than 55 local and regional organizations to bring free programs and events to the community, totaling nearly 60,000 attendees in-person and online. And last year, the three library locations and mobile library had more than 120,000 visitors.</p><p><strong>King Center and new program</strong></p><p>The King Center (630 9th St.) served more than 2,000 youth in the After School and Summer Day Camp programs. In August, the center held another successful Family Fun Day, parade and jazz fest, drawing more than 3,000 attendees, Thoms said.</p><p>During the annual Thanksgiving Meals Program, the King Center provided 6,300 plates of food. In 2023, more than 500 family were engaged in family counseling, and more than 600 children received Christmas gifts.</p><p>A new $200,000 STEAM Lab is under construction at the center. offering the community a chance to explore robotics, drones, 3D printing, laser cutting, electronics and more – expected to open this spring.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/01/SeeClick.png><p>And as part of improving communications with residents, a new city tool called “See Click Fix” a few months ago, the mayor said.</p><p>“Anyone with a concern can easily communicate non-emergency issues for relevant staff to see and respond to in a timely manner,” Thoms said. It is a convenient way to report potholes, code enforcement, street sign issues, etc. SeeClickFix users can track progress and follow up with city staff, if needed.</p><p>You can use the system (or download the app) on the <a href=#>city website HERE</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaKuhp52oerCyxZ6prGWipMC6edFmoGarpJbBpnnOn2StoJVisKrA2Gg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
