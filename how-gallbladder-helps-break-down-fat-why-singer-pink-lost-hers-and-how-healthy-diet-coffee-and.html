Some 8cm to 10cm (three to four inches) long, and 2.5cm across, this hollow, pear-shaped organ sits just below the right lobe of the liver.
The gallbladder works in tandem with the liver, which produces bile, a potent digestive juice – up to a litre (35 fl oz) a day.
This passes through a series of ducts to the gallbladder, which distils it – it can concentrate bile by as much as 10 times – and stores from 30 to 50ml of the liquid."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The pain often follows the consumption of a fat-laden meal, as fat triggers the gallbladder to empty. If stones are blocking the ducts, it can’t empty; diagnosis is usually through an ultrasound or CAT scan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Gallstones are created when one of two substances – cholesterol or bilirubin – saturate in the bile and form crystals, or stones. Bilirubin is a brownish-yellow substance found in bile that is formed when old red blood cells in the liver break down.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Normally your body gets rid of bilirubin via the bowels – which explains the colour of faeces. But bilirubin-formed stones are rare; 80 per cent of gallstones are the result of cholesterol.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">How to protect your liver: hepatitis jabs, a good diet and less alcohol</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s not just what you eat, it’s also how you eat that can predispose you to gallstones.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Eating one large meal a day increases the chance of stone formation because the bile is inactive for a long stretch, which means there’s more chance for its composite parts – bilirubin and cholesterol – to distil and saturate.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">These stones can present as a problem when they are large – the largest reported in medical literature, according to the Guinness World Records, weighed 6.29kg (13.8lbs) and was removed from an 80-year-old woman in London. They are also a problem when there are many of them. Two to 20 stones is not uncommon. The record holder, another woman in her 80s, had 23,530 stones removed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s not surprising both cases were in women.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/04/03/3a380af8-8e3d-45fb-bc8d-29ad1161e6eb_4ea9a9bf.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Teoh says there is a classic mnemonic for remembering risk factors for developing gallstones: fat, fair, female and 40.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This is related to the cause of developing gallstones, which could be too much fat. For ladies who are around the age of 40, it may be related to sex hormones causing supersaturation of bile.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But this isn’t a hard and fast rule: the pop singer Pink, after all, while female and fair, isn’t fat and was only in her early 30s when she had her gallbladder removed, in 2012.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Women are three times more prone to gallbladder problems – and gallstones in particular – on account of their hormones: oestrogen increases the amount of cholesterol in the bile and progesterone slows its emptying.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Diet drug used by Elon Musk has drawbacks, say doctors – proceed with caution</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Research suggests this is more prevalent in Caucasian women. And there could be a heritable link, too, according to the latest research. This would add another “F” to the mnemonic: family history.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The first removal of gallstones was accidental. In 1687 in Germany, Stalpert van der Wiel operated on a woman who had been complaining of abdominal pain and found gallstones. Some reports suggest they popped out like bullets.</p>Aside from gallstones, says Teoh, the gallbladder can also be affected by polyps or <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">cancer</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Usually, these conditions are treated by cholecystectomy – surgical removal of the gallbladder – and most often by minimally invasive keyhole surgery. Acute inflammation of the gallbladder is sometimes treated via draining with an external tube or internal stent,” he says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/04/03/de7c95fb-4f02-42a0-9a1d-9bfbb45467de_6114a0af.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The first cholecystectomy was performed in 1882 in Berlin, Germany. This procedure, says Teoh, is one of the most common operations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While removal of the gallbladder will affect bile storage, “the liver will still secrete bile and the digestive functions won’t be seriously affected”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Some patients who have had this operation may experience diarrhoea after eating fatty foods, but the body usually adapts to this in a few months’ time,” Teoh says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Think of it as a factory still being in production without a warehouse; there may be a slightly elevated risk of hepatic – liver – problems because of the impaired digestion of fats, but a largely healthy life is entirely possible.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">The many health benefits of a plant-based diet, according to 5 new studies</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A healthy diet will support a healthy gallbladder.</p>Some studies suggest <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">drinking coffee</span></a> may help prevent gallstones and insufficient <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">vitamin C</span></a> in your diet may prompt them.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In short, eat heart-healthy food and you will be well on your way to better gallbladder health, too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLWmrcutn2avlaG5r7HSrGaaqqSesK2xjmxpam1oZn5wtM6wZKCZnKGvra3DnZyrZZiaubG%2FjJupnpmbYrGww81mnZqsXay1unnSoqWgnaJivaq6ymajqKukYrWmvtJmmKecXZ28uHnHnpilrJiueqW1xK1knKeWm7KmecCnmw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
