The chef admitted that the main reason for her decision is her 17-year-old son, Josh, who she shares with the judge. "I’ve been Hollywood for, gosh, probably nearly 20 years. You kind of grow into that name. More importantly, I’m getting divorced, but I’m not divorcing my son, he’s a Hollywood. I’m his mum, I’m not going to get rid of his name," the 55-year-old said during an appearance on <a class=hm-link href=#>Loose Women</a> on Thursday.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p style=text-align:center id=eDiXNMkWC5YY data-wc=10><strong>WATCH: Alex Hollywood clarifies why she isn't changing her surname</strong></p><p id=eMehzHsGUiJ1 data-wc=57>"I am Alex Hollywood, I write as Alex Hollywood and I am Josh Hollywood’s mum.

"I'm not even divorced yet. Until that’s complete, I won't even consider it," she told<strong> </strong>us. However, she revealed: "This is time for me, now. I haven’t been me for so many years because, like a lot of women, I lost my sense of self and gave myself to everyone else. I’m heading in a different direction to the one I'd anticipated, but I'm enjoying the ride and feel excited about the future. I am in a good place and really excited about what’s ahead. I think of it as a bit like a bungee jump. You feel nervous before it happens, but when you make that leap you think, this is amazing."</p><p id=egSmb_8qrl-2 data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Strictly's David James and Nadiya Bychkova share intimate embrace in behind-the-scenes video</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/54343589a3e7-alex-hollywood-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e8EiOp03qIcl9 data-wc=10><strong>Alex has ruled out dating until her divorce is finalised</strong></p><p id=eQiqrYQEUPuEx data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Strictly's Chris Ramsey reveals heartbreaking detail of final dance after mics left on</a></strong></p><p id=eqF5VzPLXEQcM data-wc=72>While she may have a positive outlook on her divorce now, she doesn't deny it has been a very tough time.
