That night, he lost his lovely wife, Susan, and three children in their house along 313 Carl Drive. Here is everything you need to know about what transpired.</p><h2>The Hendricks family</h2><p class=align-left>The <a href=#>family</a> consisted of David and Susan Hendricks. The couple had three children, Rebekah, Grace, and Benjamin. David was born in Morton Grove but was raised in Oak Park, Illinois.</p><p class=align-left>David Hendricks is an American businessman. He started and ran a highly successful <a href=#>business</a> in Bloomington, Illinois. He sold an orthopaedic back brace he had patented and was known as a staple of the Bloomington community.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c7bcf83d293f0f75.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Seth Wrinkles story: what happened to Eric Wrinkles son?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>David Hendricks family were members of a strict fundamentalist section of Protestantism, Plymouth Brethren. The household was run in accordance with its teachings. They mostly kept to themselves and spent most of their time with family or members of the group.</p><p class=align-left>The family lived an arguably great life until November 7th, 1983. Then, Susan and her children were found murdered lying in their bed. On one of the children's beds, there was an axe and a butcher knife.</p><h2>What happened to the Hendricks family?</h2><p class=align-left>The afternoon of November 7th, 1983, started like any other day for the Hendricks. David went about his business as usual while Susan spent time with the children. He came back in the evening, allowing Susan to go for a baby shower in Delevan.</p><p class=align-left>In the evening, David took the children to their favourite <a href=#>restaurant</a>, Chuck E. Cheese. They took food and drinks and played games until 8.00 P.M. when they left for home. By 9.30 P.M., the children were in their beds, asleep.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c4c9e1ad146f21c0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to the Vaughn family?

David then left the house after 10.00 P.M. for a business trip. Later, he would check into a hotel in Wisconsin and spend the next day selling his back brace.</p><p class=align-left>Before he starts returning home, he calls his wife. Unfortunately, the call is not answered. He calls again in the afternoon, but this attempt fails too. He then asks his assistant to try out the neighbour if they can reach out and knock at his door.</p><p class=align-left>David got worried and made a call to the Bloomington Police Department. As a result, officer Mike Hibbens and detective Dennis Oâ€™Brien were sent to the house to check on Susan and the children. Unfortunately, they discovered they were dead.</p><h2>Hendricks crime scene</h2><p class=align-left>The Hendricks family murder scene was quite strange. When the police and neighbours searched Hendricks's house, they found the mutilated bodies of Susan and three children. They had been hacked to death with an axe and a butcher knife.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8601c7c1939bc9ee.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Timothy Madden: Gabbi Doolin murder sentence and latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>There was little sign of forced entry or struggle. Additionally, even though the killings were brutal, the used weapons had been cleaned and placed next to the bodies.</p><h2>Arrest and prosecution of David Henricks</h2><p class=align-left>When David Henricks returned later that day, the police questioned him and checked for bloodstains on his clothes. However, since there was no other lead, the police decided the examine his story. After studying the children's bodies, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">medical examiners concluded</a> that David's story did not fit.</p><p class=align-left>The examiners pointed out issues with the children's last meal. Usually, the food leaves the stomach and moves into the small intestine within two hours. However, in all three children, vegetarian pizza toppings, which they had eaten that evening, were still in their stomachs.</p><p class=align-left>Investigators estimated their time of death to be sometime around 9:30 P.M. Hendricks was still at home. He was charged with murdering his family, but the police lacked a concrete motive for such actions.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ec0b422b381d0076.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Candy Jane Tucker: What you may not know about Steve-O's ex-wife</span></p></a><h2>Who killed the Hendricks family?</h2><p class=align-left>The jury found Hendricks guilty of four counts of murder after nine weeks of trial. David was sentenced to life imprisonment on December 21st, 1988. He appealed that case, but the appeals were denied.</p><p class=align-left>Journalist Steve Vogel, who followed the case closely, decided to publish a book titled <i>Reasonable Doubt</i>. In the <a href=#>book</a>, he asked questions that many people were afraid to try. When the Supreme Court of Illinois announced a review of the case, many versions of the book were published.</p><p class=align-left>Fortunately, in 1991, the Supreme court of Illinois retried the case. After seven weeks of trials, the jury found him not guilty. Therefore, David was released after serving three years in jail.</p><h2>Henricks family murder documentary</h2><p class=align-left>On October 4th, 2021, Crime Junkie Podcast released an entire episode about the murders titled, <i>Murdered: The Hendricks Family</i>.</p><h2>Where is David Henricks and what is he doing now?</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0c6998b3fd19eb37.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Nick Cordova?

He then relocated to Florida and started another orthopaedic business. He also got married again and tried to live normally. David Hendricks second wife is Gazel, and the couple currently lives in Orlando, Florida.</p><p class=align-left>The murder of the Hendricks family remains a mystery and one of the deadliest in the history of Illinois.
