Hashtags are important on almost every platform. They work by showing your content to other people who have engaged with the same hashtags you’ve used."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

While the platform’s algorithm can be notoriously inscrutable, figuring which hashtags are right for you is actually relatively simple.</p><p>Guest post by&nbsp;<strong>Randi Zimmerman</strong>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href=#>Symphonic Blog</a></p><p>Hashtags are important on almost every platform. They work by showing your content to other people who have engaged with the same hashtags you’ve used. So, if you post a video on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a>&nbsp;that’s a duet and you tag “duet” in your description, TikTok will show your video to people who have liked, shared, and used the #duet hashtag.&nbsp;Luckily, figuring out which hashtags are right for you is fairly simple. With the right hashtag strategy, you’ll increase the reach, engagement, and visibility of your posts in no time. Here’s how to do it…</p><h2>Best TikTok Hashtag Strategy for Musicians</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok is constantly evolving. With new trends and app features popping up all the time, you need to keep your finger on the pulse of what’s hot and adapt as it changes.&nbsp;</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Click To Tweet</a></p><h3>Step 1: Set Goals</h3><p>The key to any successful strategy is having clear, actionable goals set in advance. Ask yourself:</p><ul><li>“What am I trying to do by posting this video?”</li><li>“Who am I trying to reach?”</li><li>“What do I want them to do? (Share it? Stream my music on Spotify? Follow me?)</li></ul><p>Whatever you decide, keep these goals in mind with everything you do. If you want to reach a wider audience, using the most popular hashtags works wonders. If you want more meaningful engagement, narrow your audience down to your specific demographic with more niche hashtags.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Finding your niche</a>&nbsp;is important in anything you do. On TikTok, it’s no different. Utilizing what makes your music unique helps engage a more loyal audience and secure yourself within a more manageable, less saturated space.</p><h3>Step 2: Search Hashtags on TikTok&nbsp;</h3><p>Go ahead and open the app,&nbsp;tap on the “Discover” tab on the bottom of your screen, and scroll through the previews of all the trending hashtags.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/blog.symphonicdistribution.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_5598-e1612372939173.png><p>Next, you want to dive a little deeper. In the search bar at the top, go ahead and search whatever hashtags are relevant to you. Once you hit search, you’ll be able to see related hashtags and view counts for each of them.</p><br><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/blog.symphonicdistribution.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_5600.jpg><p>With a quick Google search, you’ll see that the most popular hashtags for musicians are:&nbsp;#music,&nbsp;#singer,&nbsp;#artist,&nbsp;#songwriter,&nbsp;#livemusic,&nbsp;#newmusic, and the list goes on and on.</p><p>However, these are just the most popular,&nbsp;overall&nbsp;hashtags. If you’re looking for more interactive engagement with a more segmented fanbase, we recommend looking into artists like you on the platform and checking out the hashtags that are popular in their circles.</p><p>Make a solid list of these and keep them in mind for your own efforts.</p><p>——</p><h4>Expand your mind…</h4><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How the TikTok Algorithm Really Works</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Use TikTok’s Video Editor for Instagram Stories</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Figure Out The Best Time to Post on TikTok</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Grow Your Followers on TikTok</a></p><p>——</p><br><h3>Step 3: Get to work!</h3><p>Once you have this list ready to go, it’s time to strategize. —&nbsp;Here’s what you should know…</p><ul><li>Mix popular hashtags with less competitive ones for a further reach.</li><li>Don’t use more than 6 hashtags at a time.&nbsp;(As a rule of thumb: stick with 2 trending, 2 viral, 2 niche / video specific tags.)</li><li>Check in on the current trending hashtags every week.&nbsp;(TikTok is relatively new and always changing, so you need to stay on top of what’s hot and adapt your hashtags to what’s trending.)</li></ul><h3>In Conclusion…</h3><p>There’s no denying the immense power TikTok holds and the opportunities it fosters for artists looking to gain international recognition.
