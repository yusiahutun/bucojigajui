His son Don Jr. is marketing “FREE TRUMP” mugshot T-shirts (US$29.99) and posters (US$19.99).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On the other side of the political divide, the Lincoln Project, a prominent anti-Trump group founded by Republicans, is selling shot glasses (US$55.00 for six) with the mugshot and “FAFO”, an acronym for “Fuck Around and Find Out”, a rallying cry among Trump critics. Etsy, the crafts website, has dozens of mocking products, including a Taylor Swift concert T-shirt parody (US$26.00).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Los Angeles, a T-shirt store unaffiliated with any campaign, had already started selling tops emblazoned with the image on Friday afternoon.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think it’s very classic consumerism for this country,” said shopper CJ Butler from Atlanta, Georgia. “Hey, it’s Trump. He sells everything, so why not have a T-shirt?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/08/26/93d3180c-38ab-485a-92e4-d40093a97134_266418ee.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The image could be a huge fundraiser for the Republican candidate, some political strategists predict.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“His superfans are going to see this and it will be a fist-pumping exercise for them to send in that US$25 and get that shirt or that mug,” said David Kochel, a veteran Republican presidential campaign operative in Iowa. “It’s kind of sad at the end of the day that the campaign is going to celebrate his indictment over 13 criminal charges – but that’s where our politics is.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Trump has for months sought to leverage the criminal probes against him to rally support from his base, starting with his first indictment in New York. His fundraising groups, including his past and current presidential campaigns, have reported investing more than US$98 million in merchandise operations since 2015, buying items like bumper stickers, hoodies and coffee mugs to sell.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Trump and all co-defendants meet deadline to surrender at Georgia jail</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Speaking to Reuters after the Republican debate on Wednesday, co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita said his team had been focused on turning the four indictments into a positive, “making sure that we were making lemonade at every opportunity, which I think we did”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Veterans of other political operations say campaigns can make a 50 per cent profit or more on their merchandise sales, and LaCivita on Thursday warned off those trying to make money from the image without the campaign’s permission.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">What legal rights, if any, Trump’s campaign may have over the mugshot’s reproduction are unclear, however. The photo was distributed by the Fulton County court to media outlets.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/08/25/clean-thumb_1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">03:28</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Mugshot taken of Donald Trump in US presidential 1st after he surrenders in Georgia election case</p><p>Mugshot taken of Donald Trump in US presidential 1st after he surrenders in Georgia election case</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mug shots taken by US federal courts are generally in the public domain, although Georgia’s state policy may be different.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many US states have “right of publicity” laws that prevent the use of a person’s image in commerce without their permission. Federal trademark law also bars false advertising and endorsements, and Trump is also likely to be able to sue under other state laws.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But political parody goods may receive some protection from intellectual-property claims under the United States Constitution, and lawyers say that whether Trump would actually sue is more of a strategic question than a legal one.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In all likelihood, given how polarising Trump has been, and everything that is already in the marketplace around his likeness, it would not likely be a legal priority,” trademark lawyer Josh Gerben said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/08/25/clean-thumb_1.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Trump’s pose, glaring into the camera with his face tilted down, echoes his trademark pose in The Apprentice, the reality television show he starred in for several years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The former president told Fox News Digital in an interview on Thursday night that he only did the mugshot because Georgia officials insisted. “It is not a comfortable feeling – especially when you’ve done nothing wrong,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Rick Wilson, a co-founder of the Lincoln Project flogging mugshot wares online, dared Trump’s campaign to sue him in a Friday post on X.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Trump’s people are certainly viewing it as a powerful image, and his opponents are also viewing it as a powerful image,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miuqKqcmXy2usitnJ1lo6mutbHSZpqappGZrnCt0a2gnKSVZIBzf5Fsb3FnlJ7DqrDEnWSuq12auqO%2BwJycrGWkp8KuvIymrKCrmKTBbrnEq5qhmZ6ZtrSx</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
