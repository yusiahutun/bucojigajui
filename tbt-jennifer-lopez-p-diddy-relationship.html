Diddy, Puff Daddy, Puffy, Brother Love, and briefly Swag), and Golden Globe and Grammy-nominated singer and actress Jennifer Lopez, 53, began dating around the release of Lopez's debut album On The 6, which came out in the summer of '99.

And OK, Diddy probably didn't have a lot to do with that, but his presence kind of counts for something. He told Entertainment Tonight he thought the daring gown "was gonna really change the game as far as for her and fashion," and he was right on the money.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-breakup></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Breakup</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Where to begin …</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In late December of 1999, Lopez and Combs found themselves in legal trouble after a night out in N.Y.C. evolved into a dance club shooting that left three people seriously injured.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to New York Magazine, Puffy accidentally knocked a drink from the hand of one of the club's patrons, instigating a verbal and physical fight that quickly escalated into a shoot-out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Combs and Lopez were arrested after fleeing the scene with a gun in the trunk of their Lincoln Navigator. The charges against Lopez were soon dropped, but it's unclear exactly how soon that was — according to an inflammatory front page from the New York Daily News, Jen's "Night In Hell" culminated in 14 hours spent in jail. Other sources reported that Lopez was released after just one hour. The arrest drama buoyed a stream of endless breakup rumors until their ultimate split in 2001.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>New York Daily News/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Puff Daddy, represented in part by former O.J. Simpson defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran, was eventually acquitted as well — but not before he and J.Lo had called it quits. Just one month ahead of his trial, Sean released a statement confirming that he and his "love" had broken up. Fun fact: the entire incident inspired the era of P. Diddy. After his acquittal, the rapper told MTV News there was "no more Puff Daddy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though the legal proceedings no doubt put a strain on their relationship, Lopez claims that wasn't the true source of their issues. In 2003, she told Vibe that her relationship with Diddy marked "the first time I was with someone who wasn't faithful."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was in this relationship with Puff where I was totally crying, crazy and going nuts, it really took my whole life in a tailspin," Lopez continued, "I never caught him [cheating] but I just knew. He'd say he was going to a club for a couple of hours and then never come back that night."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">J.Lo's "torrid" relationship with Diddy made her reevaluate her future and ultimately led her to husband no. 2, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Cris Judd</a>. "I had to think, do I want to be home with kids in 10 years wondering where somebody is at three in the morning?" she shared.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Infidelity aside, Lopez and Combs remain ridiculously friendly. Diddy isn't afraid to admit that J.Lo was "without a doubt" one of his great loves. The exes have been spotted together at various functions throughout the years, even at the final performance and after-party for Lopez's Las Vegas residency.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ethan Miller/Getty Images</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-where-they-are-now></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Where They Are Now</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Combs has released various albums since his and Lopez's split. The rapper even edged into his ex's territory in 2008 when he received critical acclaim for his role in the made-for-TV adaptation of A Raisin in the Sun.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though Combs never married, he has six children — four of whom he shares with the late Kim Porter (Quincy, King, Jessie, and D'Lila). He shares his oldest biological son (Justin) with fashion designer Misa Hylton Brim. Diddy also has a daughter, Chance, with Sarah Chapman.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After finalizing her divorce from Judd, Lopez had a whirlwind relationship with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>then-fiancé Ben Affleck</a> before they called things off in early 2004. Jen quickly moved on, marrying singer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Marc Anthony</a>, with whom she welcomed twins (Max and Emme) in 2008. After their marriage ended in 2011, Lopez dated back-up dancer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Casper Smart</a> and was rumored to have had a fling with Drake before she got together with retired MLB star <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Alex Rodriguez</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following her split from Rodriguez in April 2021, Lopez has (to the delight of everyone with an internet connection) <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>reunited with Gigli co-star and ex-fiancé Affleck.</a> They wed in July 2022.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since splitting from Diddy, Lopez's career has flourished. The multi-hyphenate has since released six albums, appeared in dozens of films, starred in her own TV show, and created numerous best-selling product lines.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGekl8FutsSnpaKelad6rbvPnrFmqF2ZtqWw2GapnqSRqbawutKhoKk%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
