Have a nice day.</li><li>I was bored, so I typed in "something funny," and this came up. I was disappointed until I looked at all the comments and was entertained. LOL.</li><li>This video was so unfunny that I laughed. Like it's so bad, it's a good thing.</li><li>You made me realize YouTube is life, man! I can't stay a day without checking your new uploads.</li><li>I was laughing so hard after watching this that my mom started laughing at me.</li><li>I listened to all you said while nodding my head and shouting, "yeah! yeah!" You have a clever way of getting around things.</li><li>I am known to talk, but after hitting me with pure truth, I have no words. You opened my eyes.</li><li>I cracked up so hard watching this is one of the best compilations I've seen a great video.</li><li>Your words are hilarious and sad at the same time. There is so much truth here!</li><li>These try not to laugh challenges are only funny when you're watching someone reacting to them, trying not to laugh.</li><li>Before I started the video, I thought, "I'm not going to laugh."

Show your verbal humor by playing around with words so that people react to that with likes, happy emojis, <a href=#>funny comments</a>, and so on. Below are some best YouTube comments to get likes:</p><ul><li>I watched your videos at night with my two dogs in tow. They laughed and laughed and laughed. If my dogs would do something extraordinary, they could be on your show.</li><li>The scream that came out of me because of you! I fell off my seat laughing.</li><li>Somebody should take the microphone away from this young man before he tells all our secrets to the daughters of Eve.</li><li>You got a die-hard fan in me. I love your way of thinking. I just hollered so loud. Lmfao.</li><li>The dude had been waiting for this moment his entire life to shine. Go for it and let nobody tell you anything.</li><li>I knew it was about to get down! Your answers slay. Who is going to send this to my BFF?</li><li>Why would someone dislike this video when it has got some truth?! My Android has hit my concrete floor too many times to count, and not even a scratch is on the screen. An iPhone would break if I yelled at or stared at it too hard.</li><li>My parents have a love-hate relationship with you, even though you've never met them. They hate to see me begging them for concert tickets and almost crying whenever your songs play but love you for making me happy. They gifted me your record.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/46121fa223044f17.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ funny wedding captions for Instagram</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9d1a682c7cdcaec6.jpg><ul><li>I endorse your message with a packet of popcorn. I am here for the good vibes, sis.</li><li>The eye roll and gasp I did after watching this, lmao!! You ripped their souls apart. Tell them, girl, and a little louder.</li><li>I always knew my favorite YouTuber had money. That dress is fantastic!</li><li>Good answer! I felt for them when you destroyed their backward way of thinking.</li><li>Ain't what you told the truth! Lmao. I am only here for the violence, homeboy.</li><li>Oh! That one caught me off guard. Somebody, please hold me before I die of laughter. I am weak.</li><li>You deserve a front seat at the next national men's conference and are officially invited as the key speaker. Thanks for speaking up for men!</li><li>Your funny video made me scream in the public vehicle. The tout just threw me out. How do I get home?</li><li>That conversation escalated too quickly. I hide my face in shame on their behalf. Bro, you looked deep into their souls and roasted them real good!</li><li>I wasn't not ready for your response. You gave them a piece of their own medicine. I had to rush to the comments section. Lol.</li><li>My girl just served them violence for breakfast. I would not lie! That was a solid clap back.</li><li>95% of teens these days listen to the same crappy pop repeatedly. If you're one of the 5% who still listens to real music, thumb this up, then copy & paste it to at least five videos. Don't let the spirit of rock and roll die!</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c3ddac02bc1dadd6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>150+ funny comments on friends pic on Instagram to crack them up</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e3a882847d8dab6e.jpeg><ul><li>Comment on trending news and topics because such things can easily trigger people to like or respond to your comment.</li><li>Write inside jokes about that particular group.
