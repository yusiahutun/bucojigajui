Waking up on Christmas morning and finding a fresh orange in your stocking was considered a luxury.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">For some families, especially ones that lived in cold areas, oranges were an exotic treat. Tobias Roberts, a writer for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tobias-roberts/the-orange-in-the-stockin_b_6376126.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the Huffington Post" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">the Huffington Post</a>, recalls his Midwestern grandmother's fascination with the fruit. "As a child, every Christmas she would find an orange in the toe of her stocking; a mysterious fruit brought all the way from some exotic warm place called Florida," he wrote. "It was special and unique, because of its rarity and because of the natural limitations that made oranges a scarce commodity in Michigan." Eating this tropical fruit was a fun way for kids to celebrate the holidays.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">There's also one more piece of history we can thank for this Christmas tradition—the legend of St. Nicholas. The jolly ol' fellow gave three gold balls to a poor man whose daughters couldn't marry because he couldn't afford the dowries, according to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-legend-of-the-christmas-stocking-160854441/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Smithsonian.com class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Smithsonian.com</a>. The tale says that St. Nicholas tossed the gold down the man's chimney, where it ended up in the daughters' stockings, which were drying by the fire. Later in history, people began to honor the story and saint by gifting oranges instead of spheres of gold.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Today, the fresh fruit has been replaced by fun gadgets and other gizmos, but we'll always love the idea of giving our friends and loved ones something sweet to eat.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">(h/t <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.thekitchn.com/heres-why-we-put-oranges-in-stockings-at-christmas-holiday-traditions-from-the-kitchn-213985 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Kitchn class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Kitchn</a>)</p><span class="css-1s9owpq e19xk9rq1"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/5d1519db-faa6-41ec-8472-cb38226b737d_1516809727.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Jessica Leigh Mattern" title="Headshot of Jessica Leigh Mattern" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Jessica Leigh Mattern is a web editor and writer who covers home, holiday, DIY, crafts, travel, and more lifestyle topics.
