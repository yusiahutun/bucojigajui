It seems the <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> is going from strength to strength, even if fans <a href=# rel=nofollow>felt torn over their date night photos at the mall</a> in Singapore earlier this month. The duo went official last September when the <a href=#>music</a> star was seen at Arrowhead Stadium to support the 34-year-old, and they’re embracing whatever time they have together. Now, it’s reported Travis has forked out almost $8 million so far throughout the relationship as a result of the price of dating Taylor Swift. Let’s break it down.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-price-of-dating-taylor-swift-8-million>The price of dating Taylor Swift – $8 million?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-1738322026-1024x910.jpg><p>The athlete has been the limelight for some time but his <a href=#>celebrity</a> status has been elevated with his girlfriend.</p><p>His net worth is estimated to sit at around $50m, while his new Lover’s is a cool $1.1 billion. Trav, who also hosts a podcast with his brother <a href=#>Jason Kelce</a>, is in the third year of a four-year deal with the Chiefs, worth $57.25m. He’s the fourth-highest-paid tight end in the league.</p><p>While Travis isn’t exactly strapped for cash, the price of dating Taylor Swift has quickly spilled over to several million, <a href=# rel=nofollow>according</a> to the New York Post.</p><p>Valerie Greenberg, pop culture lifestyle expert, said: “Travis Kelce always comes to play – not just on the field, but in his everyday romance with Taylor Swift – sparing no expense.</p><p>“He isn’t afraid to open his heart and his wallet.”</p><p>Some of the biggest changes he’s made since they began dating, was buying his <a href=#>new Kansas City mansion</a>, for $6m. He moved out of his $1m home to a bigger pad with more security.</p><p>This was something his brother Jason spoke about too, on their <a href=#>podcast New Heights</a>. A crazed fan was knocking on the window the day he moved in, as part of the mania around the celebrity now.</p><p>We’re sure there’s more measures put in place to keep him safe in the 17,000-square-feet real estate dream.</p><p>Other purchases will include his private jet trips to see Swift in Argentina, Australia and recently, Singapore.</p><p>An aviation specialist estimated his trip to Argentina would cost around $300,000, $340,000 for Down Under, and $570,000 for Singapore. The last 19-hour trip would have needed a refuelling stop for the long journey. Although Taylor may have lent her own jet for some of these trips, but that hasn’t been confirmed.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-splashed-out-for-valentine-s-day>Travis ‘splashed out for Valentine’s Day’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-1968530700-1024x734.jpg><p>Sources claimed he then forked out $2,199 for a Venus et Fleur Round Grandiose arrangement of Eternity Roses, that can last up to a year, and a second bouquet of flowers ($2,100), and a 24-karat gold rose sculpture ($3,020).</p><p>Other reports claim he bought the Cruel Summer hitmaker a black lambskin Dior bete, $1050, a Bottega Veneta bag, $5,100, Celine hat, $1,100 and a Hermes scarf, $1,300.</p><p>Pretty pricey St Valentine’s Day, eh? But perhaps he didn’t mind the price because he was smitten with dating Taylor Swift.</p><p>He then bought custom matching <a href=#>bracelets with the initials TNT</a> (Taylor and Travis), with pave diamonds, last month. Wove Made Inc made the jewelry for the athlete and cost $6,360.</p><p>Lastly, Trav spent $1m on a VIP suite for Taylor and his friends and family to watch him at the <a href=#>Super Bowl</a>.</p><p>He joked on his podcast at the time: “[I’m] counting how much money I’m spending on this damn Super Bowl for family and friends to come. Just making sure I’m on top of those finances and losing all this money.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2aGcMDHnmSpqpmYsm67xWabmqyZo7RurYymrKyhk2K2pLvNZqOio5ViwaLFy6ipZqunnrO1edOrmK%2Bho2K4prjCnmShmaNiwLGxza1kpqGcobawutJo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
