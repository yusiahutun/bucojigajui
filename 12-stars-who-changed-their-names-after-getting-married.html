Over <a href=#>70% of people</a> opt to share a name with their new spouse after tying the knot and that counts celebrities too. Even though it may seem like a lot of stars choose to retain their given name, it's not always the case. While some opt to completely change their name, like Hailey Bieber, others decide to simply add their spouse's name to their own, like Priyanka Chopra Jonas. And sometimes, they choose to keep their married name strictly for personal use. But whatever decision they make, it's clear that it holds a lot of special meaning.</p><p>Find out which celebs changed their names after tying the knot…</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:2f732750-2f57-4870-94c9-17d99d998eb1 data-container-ref=toofab:article:3e5be5af-8f23-4935-a7da-f7f06deba9dc data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/bd/5by4/2022/07/18/bd39c0c81b314b149076cdc36fee8560_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">OnTheJLo.com</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jennifer Lopez Wanted to Change Her Last Name to Affleck 20 Years Ago</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>1. </strong><a href=#><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></a></p><p>Jennifer Lopez surprised fans not only when she tied the knot with Ben Affleck in a Las Vegas chapel but also when she filed paperwork to change her last name.

When I married my husband, I wanted to take his last name. I was on tour and it takes a lot of paperwork so when I was pregnant, I had time to do it! I didn't want to be Stacy Ann Duhamel.

Jessica legally changed her last name to that of her husband, although she decided to keep her maiden name professionally. She admits that even though her name is Jessica Johnson on official records, she sometimes uses her famous last name to get into restaurants!</p><p>"It depends on what restaurant it is. If it's a hard restaurant to get into, I will definitely say Simpson, it helps a little bit," Jessica <a href=#>joked</a>.</p><p><strong>12. </strong><a href=#><strong>Vanessa Lachey</strong></a></p><p>Prior to tying the knot with Nick Lachey, Vanessa Lachey went by her maiden name, Minnillo. She says she wanted to take Nick’s name because she's "old fashioned" and knew it would mean something special to her husband.</p><p>"We talked about it and he was so sweet. He said, 'Whatever you want, I understand.' And I said, 'But would it mean a lot to you if I took it? Because I'm old fashioned and I want to.' And he said, 'What guy wouldn't want their girl to take their name fully?' [But] He didn't push me, no, no, no," Vanessa told <a href=#>People</a>.</p><p><strong>13. </strong><a href=#><strong>Jay Mohr</strong></a></p><p>In a less-traditional route, Jay Mohr took his wife Nikki Cox's last name when they got married -- adding it as a second middle name after they tied the knot in 2008.</p><p>"For me, it makes so much sense. She took my last name, I took her last name as another middle name; John Ferguson Cox Mohr," he explained during an appearance on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Preachers</a>. "Her family devoured me whole, they live in Los Angeles, these are the people I have, these are the people here now, that will hold me, touch me, kiss me and love me. They've accepted me and taken me entirely, the least I can do is take three letters and put it on some paperwork."</p><p>He filed for divorce hours after that TV appearance.</p><a id=gallery-link-c1e993fe-ab1d-47d6-83f5-79e613590727 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:c1e993fe-ab1d-47d6-83f5-79e613590727 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:3e5be5af-8f23-4935-a7da-f7f06deba9dc data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e2/4by3/2022/08/02/e2ddbf4dce854489aee29e167942ab38_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j3BmbGhfZn9uv9Oaqaxlp528bq%2FHmqWgnZRiwamxyKtkp5mdmsBurcWtnKtll5rBtbXNoGSmmaKntqawjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
