She collects rare, old models; finds new parts online; and restores the vehicles herself. If you're thinking that sounds like an old-school boys' game, gear up, because times are changing, and Sweeney's TikTok, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.tiktok.com/@syds_garage?lang=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=syds_garage class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">syds_garage</a>, is proof.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I've always been a huge fan of vintage vehicles," Sweeney tells BAZAAR.com at eBay Motors' New York Auto Parts Show at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://classiccarclubmanhattan.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Classic Car Club Manhattan" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Classic Car Club Manhattan</a>, where we admire her newly restored cherry red Bronco. "My babysitters (twin sisters) when I was little actually used to be race car drivers, and I'd go to the track a lot, and I thought I was going to be a race car driver when I grew up."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Sweeney knows her hobby has drawn eyes because of how "random" and rare it feels for a Gen Z woman, but she hopes her openness about it helps break down the gender roles that exist within the vintage automobile world and reinforces the fact that women don't have limits.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I think people just have to not be afraid of putting themselves in a male-dominated environment," she says. "Like, I know that there's so much I have to learn, and I think it's okay to not know everything. You only learn if you are there and you're putting yourself there, so I think if we just support women and push them to try harder and challenge themselves, we'll get there."</p><img alt="sydney sweeney" title="sydney sweeney" width=3000 height=1688 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ebay-motors-nyaps-1650045834.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Adam Lerner</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The star, who plays Cassie Howard in the dark HBO drama gone viral, is dressed in a dark gray <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.outerknown.com/products/sea-suit-storm data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="jumpsuit by Outerknown" data-vars-ga-product-id=e287110f-e1e8-49c3-9f6a-717bd4ac1e2c data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale | (not set)" data-href=https://www.outerknown.com/products/sea-suit-storm data-product-url=https://www.outerknown.com/products/sea-suit-storm data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.outerknown.com%2Fproducts%2Fsea-suit-storm" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$88.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=da30ccfe-20de-42d2-93a7-1f82f9888902 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">jumpsuit by Outerknown</a> for the event, featuring a patch with her name, and black boot heels—very mechanic chic. There's no glittery Euphoria glam or metallic eye shadow in sight, rather she keeps it simple with black eyeliner and leaves her hair down in soft, casual waves.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"This is the first time anyone's seeing it," she says of her 1969 Ford Bronco, as she caresses its side and gazes at it as if it were her first child—which, in a sense, it is. On her TikTok, the actress has been sharing videos of her fixing up the car—her first big restoration project—inside her best friend's father's auto shop. Coincidentally, that friend's dad is Rod Emory, whose <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.emorymotorsports.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Emory Motorsports" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Emory Motorsports</a> business has been generating Outlaw Porsche 356s since the '90s.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"He builds and restores the most beautiful vintage Porsches, and I somehow convinced him to let me have my Bronco in the shop—because he only does Porsches," Sweeney says. "So he cleared out a little section for me, and he walked me through, and … he and the people in his shop helped me and taught me how to do everything, because there's so much to learn, and I don't know everything at all."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Sweeney says she worked on the car for about a year and a half, "which is a good amount of time," and her next car will take three years to fully restore. When I ask what that car will be, she smirks. "It's a surprise," she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It's really special," she adds, pausing to decide if she wants to reveal more. "Rod's happy I'm doing it." That's it. Our girl, the film star, the actual real mechanic, is restoring a Porsche. Oh, the TikTok content.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the meantime—as if she didn't have an entire Hollywood career to focus on as well—Sweeney is also fixing up a baby blue 1967 Ford Mustang, which she's named Britney. The beautiful vintage vehicle has made several appearances on Sweeney's TikTok lately, and she says the restoration won't take long, she's "just going to change out the engine." Casual.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While admiring the other cars in the lot at eBay Motors' first Auto Parts Show in New York—a bright blue Hellcat Pacifica minivan, a six-wheel '90s Ford Ranger, and a Prius hybrid by racer Emelia Hartford—the actress shares she can't wait to have a full garage filled with vintage dream cars. "I would love to collect them," she says. It's too hard to pick a favorite, but when I ask her what Cassie's ideal car would be, she says, "I feel like Cassie would just love to be in Nate's truck."</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/49ca5303-a74f-4d73-a0f8-6a94e1338358_1714666618.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" title="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Rosa Sanchez is the senior news editor at Harper's Bazaar, working on news as it relates to entertainment, fashion, and culture.
