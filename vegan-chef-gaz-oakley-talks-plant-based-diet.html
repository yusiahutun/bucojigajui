I went vegan overnight. I'd been in a professional kitchen for a number of years, then I left that industry and had a bit of spare time on my hands.</p><p id=eEdCTu_n4EUD data-wc=58>I wanted to play rugby again and packed on all this weight to get strong. I had followed a big protein-packed plan but after a couple of years of doing that I wasn't feeling good; it was too many calories and too much animal products in my diet – dairy, chicken, fish, it was too much for me.</p><p id=e5xhR1VtLI7e data-wc=56>I started thinking about veganism and I came across this video on YouTube called by an activist called Gary Yourofsky. I was intrigued really. After watching it I realised that veganism was the only lifestyle or diet that I'll follow now. The main reasons were the planet, the animals and my health.</p><p id=eTG2AaQV89j4 data-wc=37>Then I thought, 'What am I going to eat?!" Luckily the professional chef skills that I had enabled me to make some really tasty food and that's how I started on this social media YouTube cookbook journey.</p><p id=egxufqg7UsBL data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>The shocking health reason that made Robbie Williams go vegan</a></strong></p><h2>Did you find it difficult to switch to a vegan diet?</h2><p id=eLYkYdw0Y9J6 data-wc=37>It was exciting because I'd been on such a regimented strict diet and as soon as I went vegan the weight was off my shoulders, I could do whatever I wanted and be creative in the kitchen.</p><p id=eRleS-PlKAEf data-wc=65>Five years ago there wasn't half the amount of vegan foods you can find nowadays. I remember going to a service station and there'd be nothing there to eat. I found it difficult at first, but if I was turning vegan now, it would be the easiest thing in the world – especially if you like to eat out as every restaurant has vegan options.</p><h2>What health benefits have you found from going vegan?</h2><p id=e44fIpx6dout data-wc=63>After about two weeks of being on a vegan diet, this strange stomach issue I'd had for a while disappeared. I also felt much more vibrant, lighter and fresher – just a blast of energy. My head felt clear, I felt really good. Now, it's just normal and most days, providing I've had a good night's sleep, I feel really good in myself.</p><p id=eIB5-jR83ei1 data-wc=42>You do get a lot of energy from the diet. I can't recommend it enough. Both my parents went vegan straight after me. My dad had a massive heart operation and the vegan diet has given him this new zest of life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c0bc30453792-gaz-flat-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ednHzmfds_Wh data-wc=8><strong>Gaz says a plant-based diet helps his workouts</strong></p><h2>How do you get enough protein in your diet as a vegan?</h2><p id=eIzBWsBspIrt data-wc=42>Everyone seems to ask me where I get my protein from. I haven't dropped dead yet from protein deficiency! I don't have to worry about that at all – if you eat a well-balanced diet with plenty of whole foods, you're fine.</p><p id=e3XQ20ScB-wY data-wc=40>I really love to exercise and I train more or less every day and I have no problem. If I decide I want to put on a bit of muscle, the diet has all the nutrients and protein I need.</p><h2>Does eating plant-based help you with exercise? Does it give you more energy?</h2><p id=e0kmpR7_pV1M data-wc=34>Yes, definitely. I don't share this much on my social media but I guide a lot of professional athletes on a vegan diet because they know the benefits. Many professional athletes are vegan nowadays.</p><p id=epaoo-oMsKGB data-wc=31>On my own personal exercise journey, I haven't seen a decline in my performance. I've only seen an increase – whether that's me running my personal best or lifts being heavier.</p><p id=edHaLiRS11dB data-wc=44>On a vegan diet your recovery time is so much faster than before. I'm not a nutritionist or a scientist but I think it's because your body spends less time breaking down animal products that it can spend more time on repairing your muscles.</p><p id=esFAox-AE6-o data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Gaz Oakley's baby gem lettuce in orange sauce is quick, easy and so tasty</a></strong></p><h2>Which vegan foods do you find fill you up?</h2><p id=eGjsHZjvrQc1 data-wc=42>You can't go wrong with good complex carbs – beans and pulses. If you want a guilty treat, you can pretty much veganise anything. Whether it's the ultimate cheesy lasagne, you can swap the mince out for lentils or use vegan mince.</p><p id=eUUItjQMtMKI data-wc=59>You won't go hungry if you're prepared. I tell people to make a list of dishes they want to make on the Sunday and get all the ingredients so you're prepared. The good thing about being vegan is the basic ingredients like beans, pulses, rice, pasta, vegetables and fruit are cost-effective; I spend much less on food shopping now.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<h2>What do you eat in a typical day?</h2><p id=eCX_XsAVoVX_ data-wc=42>I'm always experimenting with new dishes but one thing I don't often change is my breakfast. I always make porridge and add cinnamon, coconut sugar and top it with fruit or some nice peanut butter or vegan Nutella if I'm feeling naughty.</p><p id=eep2D4IumLgp data-wc=42>Lunchtime, I'm one of those people who likes three big meals a day. I eat lots of stews and curries, chickpea or lentil curries and have a good carb with it like quinoa or wild rice, and some veg on the side.</p><p id=ehd7Yl80V51V data-wc=36>I get creative in the evening because I'm always testing recipes. Yesterday I made a lovely katsu curry using tofu and crispy breadcrumbs and a lovely sauce. All of these recipes are on my YouTube channel.</p><p id=eG9VxtAbQAUQ data-wc=33>I also love smoothies. They're a great way of getting extra nutrients in your diet. And I'm a big fan of sprinkling nuts and seeds on anything because of the nutrients they have.</p><h2>Can you recommend any great kitchen gadgets for the vegan diet?</h2><p id=es-mteJV5aMH data-wc=21>Yes, I'd recommend a good blender – whether you're making burgers or homemade hummus or even homemade vegan milk in there.</p><p id=eO_9lEMYRwYP data-wc=24>Always have really good knives, chopping boards and a good set of pans. You don't need anything too fancy when you're cooking vegan foods.</p><h2>Tell us about your campaign with Merchant Gourmet…</h2><p id=e-WZsMCxfrgR data-wc=34>Merchant Gourmet and I are on the same mission. I'm a vegan chef, so trying to get people to eat less meat and encourage them to do that for their health and the planet.</p><p id=erV9r7DrE-x2 data-wc=55>I feel like a lot of the time many of the products you can buy aren't natural. Merchant Gourmet is natural – beans and pulses are something that I would recommend make up the majority of your diet anyway, so when they are convenient like their packaging is, it's very efficient and handy for you.</p><h2>Gaz Oakley's lentil curry recipe</h2><p id=eGU5tHGH8rAz data-wc=6></p><h2>INGREDIENTS</h2><ul><li>1 Onion, peeled</li><li>6 Cloves Garlic, peeled</li><li>1 tbs Fresh Ginger</li><li>1 tsp Sea Salt</li><li>1 tbs Vegetable Oil, for frying</li><li>1 Pack Merchant Gourmet Puy Lentils</li><li>1 tbs Curry Powder</li><li>1 tsp Mild Chilli Powder</li><li>½ tsp Turmeric</li><li>½ tsp Ground Coriander</li><li>½ tsp Ground Cumin</li><li>½ tsp Ground Fenugreek</li><li>½ tsp Ground Cinnamon</li><li>2 tbs Tomato Puree</li><li>2 Potatoes, peeled & cubed</li><li>2 cups / 480ml Vegetable Stock</li><li>1 cup / 240 ml Vegan Cream, or Coconut Milk</li><li>1 tbs Brown Sugar</li></ul><p id=e8iM8wg4sj8I data-wc=8>Serve with Fresh Coriander & Chilli Garnish Rice</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bebd330677bd-lentil-curry-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eWEIfHyAdsFrz data-wc=4><strong>Gaz Oakley's lentil curry</strong></p><h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2><h3>Step 1</h3><p id=ePUFQ1vatkdPy data-wc=22>Add the onion, garlic, ginger and salt to your food processor with a splash of water and blitz to form a paste.</p><h3>Step 2</h3><p id=eHBmUQdwfslec data-wc=28>Place a medium-sized, non-stick saucepan over a medium heat and add the spices. Pan roast them for a minute or two before adding the paste and the oil.</p><h3>Step 3</h3><p id=e9GqKLp_YDwHG data-wc=18>Sauté the mixture for 2-3 minutes, stirring often. Add the tomato puree followed by the potato & lentils.</p><h3>Step 4</h3><p id=ei2yPleBfez0X data-wc=21>Keep cooking the mixture and stirring until everything is coated, then deglaze the pan with the vegetable stock and vegan cream.</p><h3>Step 5</h3><p id=ejqQiN1Fmm74Q data-wc=42>Add the brown sugar, then pop a lid on the pan and let the curry bubble away for 15-20 minutes. Turn the heat down low and don’t forget to stir it every 3-4 minutes, as the potato has a tendency to stick.</p><h3>Step 6</h3><p id=eG9Vrc-Y2gswL data-wc=16>After 20 minutes of cooking, the liquid should have thickened considerably and it should smell beautiful.</p><h3>Step 7</h3><p id=efbQWGgfynLFV data-wc=16>Serve the curry with rice or sides of your choice and garnish with coriander and chilli.</p><p id=eMTGWiEEYhrqy data-wc=52></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmMKqv8innGhqYGd%2BcX%2BQaWhpcGVrhHDCxKCYp2WTnbKnecaasWankaC5psWMrZilo6Niva2tza1km5mjmrFusMieq2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
