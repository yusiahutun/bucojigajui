Dressed in a loose-fitting white dress, Qualley dances in a parking lot with Manhattan and the Hudson River behind her.</p><p>At the end of her performance, it becomes clear that Qualley has an audience. Antonoff himself is perched on the hood of a car, which sits parked with its high beams trained on Qualley like a spotlight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Margaret-Qualley-Stars-in-Husband-Jack-Antonoffs-New-Music-Video3.jpg><p>As the sun comes up over the city, Qualley walks toward Antonoff, 39, with a calm, loving expression on her face. The pair embrace, and Antonoff leans his head against Qualley’s chest, hardly making eye contact with her.</p><p>“It’s so sweet and shy,” Qualley said of the intimate moment during an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Rolling Stone</a> published on Wednesday. “In real life, there’s not as much nervous tension — we’re married — but in the context of the video, I think it’s nice because it feels like a meet-cute. And it’s great because he’s not an actor.”</p><p>The Poor Things actress, who has a background in dance, also opened up about the inspiration for the video.</p><p>“I just love dancing and wanted to make up a dance for one of Jack’s songs on his next album,” she said. “This song was just really poppy and fun, and it was so fun to dance to.”</p><p>Qualley noted that she wanted the piece to “feel like a love letter to Jack,” whom <a href=#>she married</a> in August 2023. “Something that I’d want to show the kids one day,” she added of the pair’s future children.</p><p>As for Qualley’s choreography, her biggest inspiration was the late choreographer <strong>Bob Fosse</strong>, known for choreographing and directing stage musicals including Pippin and Chicago, and films including Cabaret and All That Jazz.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Margaret-Qualley-Stars-in-Husband-Jack-Antonoffs-New-Music-Video2.jpg><p>“He’s the ultimate reference, both for choreography and cinematic style,” she said of Fosse, who died at age 60 in 1987. Qualley portrayed Fosse’s former partner <strong>Ann Reinkin</strong>g in the 2019 miniseries Fosse/Verdon, which starred<strong> Sam Rockwell</strong> and <strong>Michelle William</strong>s in the titular roles.</p><p>Despite drawing from the Broadway titan, it was important to Qualley to create a “dance that anybody could do” for the “Tiny Moves” video.</p><p>“I wanted to make something that doesn’t look too performative,” she said. “It’s not like doing a big battement or pirouettes or something.”</p><p>While Qualley’s ballet training is evident in the video, she told Rolling Stone that her experience lies more in the world of competitive dance.</p><p>“I did a lot of PR for myself [early in my career] where I said I was a ballerina because I think it sounds so classy, but the reality is I’m more of a competition-style dancer,” she said. “I grew up in dance competitions, and I did do a lot of ballet, but I wasn’t trying to figure out how to make a career of it.”</p><p>The “Tiny Moves” video shoot took place a few weeks before Qualley and Antonoff <a href=#>tied the knot</a> in Long Beach Island with stars like <strong>Taylor Swift</strong>, <strong>Lana Del Rey</strong>, <strong>Cara Delevingne</strong>, <strong>Channing Tatum</strong>, <strong>Zoë Kravitz</strong> and the bride’s mother, <strong>Andie MacDowel</strong>l, in attendance.</p><p>Now that the duo are husband and wife, Qualley would like to collaborate on more videos with Antonoff if the right idea pops up.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I like doing everything with Jack,” she said. “He’s my favorite person to do anything with.”</p><p>“Tiny Moves” is the third single from Bleachers’ upcoming self-titled album, which is due out on March 8. The song was preceded by the singles “Modern Girl” and “Alma Mater,” released in September 2023 and November 2023, respectively.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSaqpeWv6bAjKqsmqScmsZusMCnmp6rXZu8s3nJmpqkZZGjwbC6zp%2BdZqGeYrumw4ybo56Zk52ys7%2BMr6CdnZ9k</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
