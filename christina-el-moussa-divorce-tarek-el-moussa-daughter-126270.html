"We had to explain that sometimes couples get divorced but that she and <a href=#>[our one-year-old son], <strong>Brayden</strong></a>, are our No. 1 priority. We’ll always be a family."</p><p>Tarek, 35, and Christina previously tied the knot in 2009.

The father-of-two has reportedly been dating the family's nanny — and his ex-wife's friend — <strong>Alyssa Logan</strong> following his split from Christina while the blonde beauty was involved with contractor <strong>Gary Anderson</strong>. <a href=#>Christina reportedly ended her short relationship with Gary earlier this week</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46cn6uho6m2r62MnqNmpZ%2BqwLStjJ2gr6eimLJuwMCrnKRllaF6rrvUrKqaZZSWwqi0056pZmlia394fI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
