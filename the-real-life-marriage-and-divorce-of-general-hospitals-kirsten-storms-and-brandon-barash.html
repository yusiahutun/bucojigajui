The actress began working on daytime television at a young age when she was cast as the teenage Isabella Black on "Days of Our Lives" in 1999. Belle became an instant hit with viewers, along with her friends like Shawn-Douglas Brady (Jason Cook), Mimi Lockhart (Farah Fath), and Chloe Lane (Nadia Bjorlin), per&nbsp;<a href=#>Daytime Confidential</a>. The actress opted to leave the sudser in 2004 and was ultimately replaced with Martha Madison. She later moved on to "General Hospital" to play the fan-favorite role of Maxie Jones — the daughter of legendary characters Frisco and Felicia Jones — where she has remained since 2005.</p><p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a href=#>Brandon Barash</a>&nbsp;appeared on shows such as "The West Wing," "24," and "Gilmore Girls" before landing the role of bad boy Johnny Zacchara on "General Hospital" in 2007. It was there that he met Storms, and the two formed a relationship. However, Barash later left "GH" and found himself at Storms' old stomping ground. The actor took over the role of Stefan DiMera on "Days of Our Lives" from actor Tyler Christopher (via&nbsp;<a href=#>Soaps in Depth</a>). When Stefan was killed off, he later played the role of his identical twin brother, Jake DiMera.</p><p>Between the pair, Storms and Barash seemed like the perfect soap opera power couple. However, they sadly couldn't make things work.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhpbIV3fI6tn55lopqurXnLop2eZZ2Wv7O1wKCcZpmemXqltdWoqZydXaSzbrPEp5yrmZxitbC%2Fz6KrmqSjYriqvtKtnKdlo6m8s7nSZpinnF2Xv6K6w6ilZpqRp660tI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
