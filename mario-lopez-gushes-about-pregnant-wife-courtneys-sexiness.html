The pair announced in mid-January through <a href=# rel=noopener data-aesra-score=linkNewWindowWarning:1;>an adorable family update video</a> that they are expecting their third child together.</p><p>A few days after their exciting news went public, the&nbsp;<a href=#>Saved by the Bell alum</a> gushed to&nbsp;<a href=#>People</a> about expanding his family. In fact, he revealed that he and Courtney have been trying to conceive for quite some time now. “If it didn’t happen, it wasn’t meant to be. Not part of God’s plan. We have one of each,” Mario said of already having one son and one daughter. “But it got in there! It snuck in, towards the end, so a bit of a Christmas miracle.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mario-Lopez-family-copy.jpg><p>Mario also revealed that he and his lady aren’t the only ones thrilled about bringing a little bundle of joy into their lives. “At first they were like, ‘Wait, what?’” he admitted of Gia and Dominic’s reactions. “They couldn’t understand. It took a second for it to register. My daughter got very dramatic. She was like, ‘If&nbsp;I have another brother, I’m telling you right now, I’m moving to Texas!’” Ha!</p><p>The TV stud doesn’t seem too worried about the baby’s gender, though. “It doesn’t matter, to be honest, as long as it’s healthy. We’re just very excited,” he gushed. “The&nbsp;gender reveal will be when it’s born!” We wish nothing but the best for Mario, Courtney and their beautiful family!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46mmKuhn2K5sLzEs2SgraOdsrR5wJumrqxdpb%2Bms82apa1lp56zpnnCqKyrrJ6axrR50p6voqaVqMBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
