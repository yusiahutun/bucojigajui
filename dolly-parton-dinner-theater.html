It recently <a href=#>added a new roller coaster</a> called Lightning Rod, which will be the world’s fastest wooden coaster when it opens in March 2016.</p><p>Aside from her music career, philanthropy and business ventures, Parton has been lighting up the small screen with stories from her childhood in&nbsp;<a href=#>Coat of Many Colors</a>, based on her song by the same name. The NBC made-for-television movie was the first in a series of three programs the network is developing from Parton’s life and work, and the second will be based on her tune “Jolene.” She recently celebrated her 70th birthday, and shows no signs of slowing down any time soon.</p><p><strong>Dolly Parton's Most Unforgettable Moments</strong></p><p><strong>See Pictures of Dolly Parton Through the Years</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnaecocZuvMCrq6imXZm2r7rEq2StoJWWwaa%2Bjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
