He was 72.</p><p>According to a statement from WNCX, Stanley died at his home on March 5th from lung cancer.</p><p>His family also confirmed his death via social media, writing: “Michael battled lung cancer for seven months with the same strength and dignity he carried throughout his life. He will always be remembered as a loving father, brother, husband, a loyal friend, and the leader of one of Cleveland’s most successful rock bands.”</p><p>Born Michael Stanley Gee, Stanley grew up near Cleveland, graduating first from Rocky River High School and then attending Hiram College on a basketball scholarship. While still in college, Stanley found his musical calling and joined the band Silk, which released “Smooth As Silk” in 1969 on ABC Records.</p><p>Four years later, while working as a manager of a local record store, he released his first solo album, the eponymously-named “Michael Stanley” via Tumbleweed Records, quickly followed that same year with “Friends and Legends” on MCA.</p><p>That same year, Stanley teamed up with singer-songwriter–lead guitarist Jonah Koslen, bassist Daniel Pecchio, and drummer Tommy Dobeck, to form the Michael Stanley Band. The group, known as MSB by fans, quickled gained a loyal following in the Cleveland market.</p><p>In 1981, broke through to mainstream success with the release of “He Can’t Love You” and “Falling in Love Again” which peaked at #33 and #64, respectively, on the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p>Despite their early success, MSB parted ways in 1986 with a final series of 12 performances at the Front Row Theater in Cleveland.</p><p>Following the dissolution of MSB, Stanley continued to record and perform around the region, both as Michael Stanley and Friends, and with the Resonators.</p><p>In the wake of MSB, Stanley also landed a job as co-host of WJW Channel 8′s “PM Magazine”, winning 11 local Emmy Awards for his contributions, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer.</p><p>As well, he spent more than 30 years on the radio at Cleveland’s classic rock station WNCX, handling the afternoon shift as well as Saturday mornings.</p><p>“He was so emblematic of that raging heart that doesn’t care that it’s gonna lose — it’s still gonna leave everything on the field. And when he wrote those songs, those kids in a city where the river caught on fire and the lake died, they felt like their lives mattered,” music critic and author Holly Gleason told Cleveland.com. “If you were a kid coming of age in Cleveland in the ’70s or the ’80s, he was our hand on the brass ring.”</p><p>Stanley’s family will hold a private memorial service. The family requests contributions in his memory to the Cleveland Food Bank (www.greaterclevelandfoodbank.org) and/or the Cleveland Animal Protective League (www.clevelandapl.org).</p><p>Stanley is survived by wife, his two daughters, his sister, a niece and five grandchildren.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ35wfJJoZ3Fno567qLHRZqqoppesv6rAxKtkmqaUYr%2BisMioZKGno6l6rrXCoZiepF2owaK6y56wZpyVlrFurdNmbmtn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
