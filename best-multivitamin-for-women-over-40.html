To make the whole process easier, they have all the nutrients you're missing in just one pill (or delicious <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>gummy</a>). While your diet should be your primary source of essential vitamins and minerals, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Molly Kimball</a>, registered dietitian and host of the podcast "Fueled," recommends a multivitamin to supplement the nutrients you get from your food. If you have a restricted or limited diet, adding a multivitamin could be especially beneficial to ensure you're receiving all the necessary nutrients, she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"My recommendation is to look for a multivitamin that contains a wide spectrum of vitamins and minerals; some may also have additional herbs or antioxidant-rich phytonutrients," she tells InStyle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And while multivitamins can be beneficial to women of all ages, Kimball especially recommends them to women over 40 because as we age, our bodies can become less efficient in absorbing particular vitamins.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"Certain micronutrients are essential for our bodies to function properly," she says. "Chromium, for example, influences our insulin response and carbohydrate metabolism. Vitamin B12 is involved in DNA production and healthy red blood cells, as well as our energy, focus, and mood. As we get older, though, we don't absorb B12 as efficiently, and can benefit from supplementation."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">So to make it even easier for you, we've rounded up the 13 best multivitamins for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>women over 40</a>, according to thousands of customer reviews.
