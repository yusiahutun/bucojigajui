Organic compounds, which contain carbon, hydrogen, and often<strong> oxygen, nitrogen</strong>, or other elements, form the basis of all living organisms. These compounds include <strong>carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids.</strong></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-5>Synthetic Compounds</h2><p>Not all compounds are naturally occurring. Synthetic compounds are <strong>artificially created</strong> through chemical reactions and have a wide range of applications. Examples include<strong> synthetic fibers, pharmaceutical drugs, and industrial chemicals</strong>.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-6>Water: The Universal Solvent</h2><p>Water is an extraordinary compound with many unique properties. It is known as the universal <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# title=solvent data-wpil-keyword-link=linked data-wpel-link=internal>solvent</a> because it has the ability to <strong>dissolve a wide variety of substances</strong>, making it essential for biological processes and everyday activities.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-7>Carbon Dioxide and Global Warming</h2><p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a compound that plays a significant role in climate change. Excessive release of CO2 into the atmosphere, primarily from human activities like burning fossil fuels, contributes to the<strong> <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# title="greenhouse effect" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked data-wpel-link=internal>greenhouse effect</a></strong> and global warming.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/3D-atomic-compound.jpg><h2 class=content-title id=title-8>Chemical Reactions and Compounds</h2><p>Chemical reactions involve the breaking and forming of chemical bonds between atoms, leading to the creation of<strong> new compounds</strong>. These reactions are responsible for the transformations we observe in the natural world and in laboratory settings.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-9>Chemical Formulas</h2><p>Chemical formulas represent compounds and provide information about their composition. They use <strong>symbols of elements and subscripts</strong> to indicate the number of atoms of each element in a compound. For example, H2O represents water, with two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.</p><p>Read also: <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><span>18 Extraordinary Facts About Pockels Effect</span></a></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-10>Properties of Compounds</h2><p>Compounds exhibit unique properties distinct from their constituent elements.
