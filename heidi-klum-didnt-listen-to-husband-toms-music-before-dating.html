Although parenting four young children can get extremely overwhelming, Heidi gushed her kids couldn’t love Tom more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/heidi-klum-husband-tom-kaulitz-daughter-leni-shopping04.jpg><p>“<a href=#>So far, so good</a>,” the former Victoria’s Secret Angel, who first met the “Love Who Loves You Back” singer on the set of Germany’s Next Top Model in February 2018, shared with <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> in September 2019. “I think it’s working out pretty good.” So sweet!</p><p>Heidi has also opened up about her relationship with Tom on other occasions. Prior to getting married at their <a href=#>romantic, Italian wedding</a> last summer, Heidi — who <a href=#>previously wed Tom in a secret ceremony in February 2019</a> — adorably revealed that her children couldn’t wait to watch her walk down the aisle.</p><p>“The kids adore Tom. They <a href=#>can’t wait for the wedding</a>!” she previously shared with the U.K.’s <a href=#>Closer magazine</a>. “They’ll be very involved in it all.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46hnKKcmWK4rcHMZpuinJ6peq210q2cp2WkpHqpwdKbmKecXam8rr%2BMpqysoZNir6ayzqucZpyRqbavs44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
