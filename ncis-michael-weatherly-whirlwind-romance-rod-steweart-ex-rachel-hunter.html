Together they share two children, Renée (born in 1992) and Liam (born in 1994).&nbsp;</p><p id=etkghK30VyV data-wc=83>In a 2019 interview with the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Daily Mail's weekend magazine</a>, Rod recalled the moment Rachel told him it was over. "I couldn't believe it," he said. "I was a rock star. You don't dump a rock star! It knocked me for six. It was a huge shock. But she was just 21 when we married and a mum a year later. My sister Mary told me she was too young for me as we were walking down the aisle. And she was right."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/559af9763b52-gettyimages-76163214.jpg><p id=eawNqMyA0fG data-wc=68>Following their separation, it appears that Rod and Rachel stayed on good terms, and he was even accepting of her relationship with Michael. In May 1999, the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Sunday Mirror</a> reported that Michael had become a frequent visitor at the supermodel's Beverly Hills home. The publication also wrote that Michael had brought his son, August, whom he shares with his ex-wife Amelia, to play with Rachel and Rod's children.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=eykcWeVsVO7 data-wc=42>Ultimately, the relationship between Rachel and Michael was brief, and by 2000, the NCIS star had started dating actress Jessica Alba.
