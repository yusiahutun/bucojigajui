According to Women‚Äôs Health, both seasons 4 and 5 are completed filming when season 3 premiered. Based on the show‚Äôs first look, Irina doesn‚Äôt seem to be getting along with the rest of the female cast members. The two ladies who like Irina, one of whom being Irina herself, and the two who despise Irina, are sharply divided on the women‚Äôs side.</p><p>‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm a bombshell, but when I was younger I had really, really bad acne,‚Äù Irina says in her introductory confessional. ‚ÄúLike, really, really bad acne. And I would always be like, ‚ÄòGuys don‚Äôt wanna date me because I have really bad acne.‚Äô‚Äù she continued.</p><p>Irina continues by saying that what matters is who she is on the inside, but all the audience knows about Irina‚Äôs inner self is that she is still worried about the fact that she had, like, like, really awful acne.</p><p>Irina is not disliked by the other ladies in the home because of her previous acne, but rather because she and her best friend Micah are gossiping all the time. The two eventually learn that one of their fellow cast members has been passed over. Irina giggles before moving in closer to hear the woman describe the graphic details of her dump.</p><p>As a result, we now know something else about Irina: She finds great delight in the failures of other women. When Irina informs Zack, her No. 1 match, that Bliss, her competition for his affection, is mistreating Irina, the psychological battle between the two women intensifies. Zack is unaware of what is happening at the Love Is Blind women‚Äôs dorm; he hasn‚Äôt witnessed Irina harass and spread rumors.
