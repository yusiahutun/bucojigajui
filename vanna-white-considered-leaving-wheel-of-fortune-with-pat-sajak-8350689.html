It's like, 'Well, wait, if you're leaving, what am I going to do? How can I stay without you?'" White told the publication in its latest issue. "It was a very hard decision for me to make, because it definitely crossed my mind."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Christopher Willard/ABC via Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added, “It's like, 'I just don't know if I can do this without you,' but I thought about it and I'm not ready to retire, so I am staying on.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">White, who was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>recently awarded a much-deserved raise</a> after reportedly making half of what Sajak earned for most of her career, will co-star alongside Ryan Seacrest when he replaces Pat next fall.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I know Ryan — he is professional, he's good at what he does, he's kind," White shared. "I think it's going to be good. He's such a nice guy and he loves what he does. He said, 'Look, I am not replacing Pat. I'm not going in to try to fill Pat's shoes. No one can ever replace him.' He says he's coming in to do a good job and to keep the show going, and I'm looking forward to working with him.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But Wheel of Fortune fans need not fret — Vanna also added that plenty of reminiscing will take place over the course of Pat’s last season in celebration of his storied career.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We are celebrating this year with Pat and all the good times, all the 41 years, all the memories," she said. "We are going to be doing some incredible stuff to say goodbye to Pat at the end of the season. We have almost a whole season to do that, to just look at all the great things that we've done together. I'm so looking forward to that. It's going to be very sad."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK571Zqlp5ldrLWqwMRmmqimo56xpr7EnWSlnZGrtq%2BzjLCfnp2cYrynecWoqa2tnpp6uLXToWSpmaRiwKK2wKRkcWtlZYN5hQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
