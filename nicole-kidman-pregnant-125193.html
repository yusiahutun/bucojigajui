"There are times when it gets put out into a family meeting and we all decide whether we can move here for a period of time and mommy can make a film or daddy can go do this," Nicole confessed, proving that another baby would fit in just fine.</p><p>Nicole and Keith are parents to two adorable daughters, Sunday, 9, and Faith, 7. At the <a href=#>2018 Golden Globes</a>, Nicole made headlines when she <a href=#>failed to mention her two adopted kids</a>, Isabella, 25, and Connor, 22, whom she adopted with her ex-husband, Tom Cruise, in her acceptance speech.</p><p>"First cab off the rank, that means my daughters are still awake so [Sunday], Faith, I love you. I’m bringing this home to you babies," she said onstage. Awkward…</p><p>Nicole's biggest challenges throughout her life has been her difficulty conceiving (which is why she adopted Isabella and Connor and welcomed Faith via surrogate). In a previous interview with Closer Weekly, one of Nicole's friends <a href=#>opened up about the actress' views on motherhood</a> now that recently hit a milestone birthday.</p><p>"Now that she's 50, Nicole knows her chances of being a biological mom again are slim," she said. "But she still chooses to keep that possibility open. If it’s in the cards, she’d be thrilled." We're crossing our fingers for her and Keith!</p><p><b>Click through the gallery below to see everything Nicole has revealed about expanding her family!</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46noJynnJp6rLXDppinZaCnsqi6wKerZmlian56f46pn6isn6h8r7XCqKOeZZuesa6tzWanq52Xo66vwIxramtraGl8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
