Moving in low Earth orbits, an artificial satellite or a spacecraft can revolve around the Earth once in about 1.5 hours. Numerous photos taken by spacecraft moving far away from the Earth show that the Earth is&nbsp;in fact a sphere.</span></span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=span><span type=text>“All our calculations in aviation and space travel are based on the fact that the Earth is a sphere which is constantly self-rotating about its axis.
