How did the market react to Evergrande’s winding up order?
Trading in the shares of Evergrande and its associated companies was halted soon after the judgment, but by then these stocks had already fallen."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Evergrande tumbled 21 per cent on the day to 16.3 cents. Shares in its unit Evergrande New Energy Vehicle slumped 18 per cent to 22.9 cents, while its property management arm Evergrande Property Services lost 2.5 per cent to 39 cents.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Shares of other indebted developers such as Country Garden Holdings and Longfor rose amid optimism that Evergrande’s collapse would remove the industry’s biggest headache and Chinese authorities are now prepared to introduce easing measures in the property sector.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Why offshore creditors will remain nervous about Evergrande liquidation</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the bond market, embattled Evergrande peers also performed well or remained stable in sharp contrast to the collapse in the developer’s bonds. “It’s quite interesting that bonds of high yield developers including Dalian Wanda, Greenland, and China Southern City, were actually trading up on Monday morning,” said Zerlina Zeng, senior director at CreditSights. “Even in the afternoon, the tone was good.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">What do analysts foresee after the sector’s biggest liquidation, in the context of China property’s recent performance?</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The biggest-ever liquidation order on a Hong Kong-listed company came at a time when markets were expecting a stimulus package from Chinese authorities to calm sluggish stocks and stabilise home sales performance.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Analysts said it could inject a dose of reality in future restructuring proposals, with some predicting it could even hasten the process. Here is a sample of views.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Zerlina Zeng, senior director at CreditSights:</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">We do not expect Evergrande’s liquidation to significantly dent risk sentiment towards China credits, especially investment grade ones. China IG credits and non-defaulted property credits performed well today despite the Evergrande headline, which we think was due to the increasingly supportive macro and property policies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The liquidation was not a surprise to the market given Evergrande’s creditors had not agreed on the restructuring terms; and the company’s dollar bonds had been trading at 1-2 cents, indicating a minimal recovery rate. Given that most of the company’s assets are onshore, we do not think that offshore bondholders would receive substantial recovery proceeds from the liquidation. In addition, it is unclear whether the Hong Kong court’s liquidation order could be enforced onshore; there has been some mutual recognition of bankruptcy proceedings between Hong Kong and mainland courts, but the enforcement is difficult in practice.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Homebuyers are already avoiding purchasing homes from privately-run developers with weak balance sheets, so Evergrande’s liquidation shouldn’t have much of an incremental impact on homebuyers sentiment. That said, home sales are unlikely to quickly turn around this year as home prices continue declining; for those looking to buy their first homes or upgrade their existing homes, they would likely purchase new projects launched by state-linked developers or from the secondary market. As a result, we expect continued bifurcation between state-linked and privately-run developers in home sales and cash generation.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2024/01/29/Evergrande-clean-thumb_3.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">08:36</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">A vanishing fairyland dream: how China Evergrande rose, then crashed</p><p>A vanishing fairyland dream: how China Evergrande rose, then crashed</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Kenny Ng, a strategist at Everbright Securities International:</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It may further impact the confidence of mainland creditors and increase the difficulty of Evergrande’s restructuring in mainland China. At the same time, this may also affect the current investors’ confidence in the mainland real estate industry and the willingness of mainland residents to purchase properties. This has the potential to dampen sentiment in both the economy and the capital market.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Philip Law, China’s real estate industry leader at Deloitte:</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The owners of Chinese property and the creditors in the sector will adopt a more realistic approach to identify the common interest for a scheme of arrangement. But the interest of each Chinese property owner, each creditor, is different, complicating the situation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The peers of Evergrande might feel some pressure and therefore some stakeholders will take a realistic approach – for example, accept the proposed hair cut, and try to get back as much, and as quickly as possible.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Raymond Cheng, managing director, head of China and HK property at CGS-CIMB Securities:</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Evergrande peers will be even more sincere to discuss restructuring details with creditors after the Evergrande verdict, as obviously no one wants to be ordered to liquidate.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I expect most of the other private developers to agree to a plan with key creditors to avoid a court ordered liquidation.
