The pregnant 44-year-old was hanging out with her best pal <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Addison Rae</strong></a>, 22, who twinned in a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Barbiecore</a> two piece as the two soaked up some Los Angeles sunshine on Monday, July 3.

Other photos show the mom-to-be staying cool with a dark denim bucket hat as she lounged by her Calabasas pool. Kourt kept her caption simple with just an arrow through a heart, pink bow, a pink bikini, flamingo and two pink hearts, a nod to the color of the two ladies’ swimsuits (and perhaps the upcoming <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Barbie: The Movie</a>&nbsp;coming out on July 21).</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The Kardashians&nbsp;on Hulu star <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>announced her fourth pregnancy</a> — and first with husband &nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Travis Barker</strong></a>, 47 — on June 16 in the&nbsp;cutest&nbsp;way! While in the audience at <strong>Blink-182</strong>‘s Los Angeles show on June 16, Kourtney held up a sign simply reading, “Travis I’m Pregnant.” Fans of the band immediately recognized the sign as a callback to the band’s 1999 video for “All The Small Things” in which a female fan can be seen doing the same thing.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Travis immediately came down off the stage to kiss his wife in the crowd, as his band mates declared on stage, “Somebody’s having a baby!” Shortly after, the couple shared a clip of the moment to Instagram, sharing their happy news with the world.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>This marks the fourth baby for Kourt, who shares kids<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> <strong>Mason</strong>, 13,<strong> Penelope</strong>, 10, and <strong>Reign</strong>, 8</a>, with <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Scott Disick</strong></a>. Travis also has three kids: stepdaughter <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Atiana</strong>, 24, son <strong>Landon</strong>, 19, and daughter <strong>Alabama</strong>, 17</a>. The pregnancy announcement also comes after a lengthy IVF journey which Kourt documented on the family’s Hulu reality series, revealing they stopped treatment rounds after they were unsuccessful.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>On June 24, Kourtney and Travis held a <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>gender reveal party</a> with friends and family where they confirmed that baby number seven will be a boy!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e49tZqSnpafBr7HYZqKaqpSWwKm1wKdkqaqVnLuiutNmp6Kmm2KvqrfIp6BmmZSZtrS7zWapmp1dpbWwwM6sZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
