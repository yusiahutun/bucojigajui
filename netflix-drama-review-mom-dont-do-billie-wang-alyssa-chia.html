Billie Wang, Alyssa Chia lead Taiwanese story about</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-08-16</div><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It has been five years since the sudden death of Mei-mei’s husband, Guang-hui (Johnny Kou Hsi-shun), and she is ready to get back in the game – not least to shore up her financial situation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/07/14/da55b34c-9ce2-4499-9395-ff48c9bbb2c2_1126e908.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She may own the family flat, but her late husband’s savings are quickly running out, and Mei-mei is eager to regain her independence. Her flirtations soon get her into trouble, however, after accepting the advances of her neighbour’s husband and a string of other online suitors.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the same time, Ru-rong’s younger sister Ruo-min (Alice Ko Chia-yen) returns home with her tail between her legs, having discovered that her good-for-nothing boyfriend Cha (Austin Lin Po-hung) has been two-timing her. She drowns her heartbreak in alcohol, but soon invites this diabolical deadbeat back into her life, and the family home.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As all of this plays out, the benevolent spirit of Guang-hui watches over the family, and they, in turn, share with him the doubts and frustrations they cannot tell each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/07/14/c55d869c-4a76-4559-b53c-27d1b0939b8a_1126e908.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Over the course of the series, these women become embroiled in all manner of romantic, dramatic and comedic escapades, as tensions at home rise and fall, more often than not because of the invasive and emotionally codependent nature of their family dynamic.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ru-rong bumps into the handsome Xiang-yu (Chris Wu Kang-ren), the former flame of her fickle, materialistic colleague and best friend Kate (Vicky Tseng Wan-ting), and begins a secret courtship that seems almost too good to be true.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meanwhile, Ruo-min tracks down Cha’s other girlfriend, a young and overly affectionate online influencer (Chloe Xiang Jie-ru), who hopes they can become friends rather than rivals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/07/14/a7e67acc-0f01-47e5-9af4-f37856928e38_1126e908.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As the title suggests, however, it is Mei-mei’s antics that cause the most drama. Whether interfering in her daughters’ affairs or getting in over her head in the dangerous world of online dating, Mei-mei’s arrogance, stubbornness and persistence drive the narrative forward from one domestic crisis to the next, frequently sending the family careering over a cliff.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She goes on a spending spree she can’t afford, almost falls foul of an internet con artist, and at one point even breaks her hip, causing the entire family to restructure their routines around her. Everything comes to a head, however, when she meets Robert (John Henry Richardson), a modest Australian gentleman who might just prove the perfect match.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The central message of Chen’s novel, which has been enthusiastically adapted for the screen by Bing Hsu, and directed by Chen Weiling and Lee Chun-hong, is unsurprisingly that family needs to stick together, no matter how excruciating that may seem on a day-to-day basis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/07/14/c59973bd-6ef3-4fef-8b21-311d9d06b6f3_112e2a97.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ru-rong inevitably garners the most sympathy, in large part because of the performance of Alyssa Chia, who ensures she remains likeable even when making poor choices.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ru-rong is relatively content to be alone, even if handsome hunks like Xiang-yu cause an occasional lapse in judgment. She can stand up to Mei-mei’s relentless recklessness better than anyone, while everyone in her orbit provides rich material for her next novel.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Alice Ko fares less well with Ruo-min, who seems to be defined simply as too young to stop making terrible decisions. It’s a dismissive take on a character, who must be in her mid-30s but is often portrayed like she’s still a teenager.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/07/14/a3f8c9fd-fc93-4d6e-8667-ffcdae18f662_1126e908.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sympathetic male characters are in short supply. Men of all ages are painted as lecherous, unfaithful and duplicitous, with the show’s most likeable lad a male escort (played by Wasir Chou Yung-hsuan) and devoted companion to Mei-mei’s oldest friend.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Everyone else pales in comparison to the memory of the family’s dearly departed patriarch, but that is almost certainly intentional. Mom, Don’t Do That! is about filling that void, or rather battling against the urge to leave it open and empty.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As a show about healing wounds, recalibrating relationships, and moving forward, it delivers with unbridled sincerity, even as the histrionic attempts at humour prove as tortuous as a family gathering.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mom, Don’t Do That! is streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLKvwMSrq5qhnqKyr8COmqmtoZOhsnB%2FkHFsa2liZLumwMWloLFllKeurq2Mq5yvoZWseq67zGabqKakYrGwecGio6WhlWLEorrGZpilsaOorm6vx6KY</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
