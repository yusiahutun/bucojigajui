However, our interview process is very strong leading to only the right candidates.</p><p>We being a company with a great technical skillset and strength were not able to find the experienced candidates as the candidates’ skillset did not match their experience.

Computer Science from Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, I joined Quark Media House as Software Engineer in July 2001. I spent 9 years developing Java-based Enterprise applications including Quark proprietary Workflow Management System and Content Management System. My key roles included designing, architect, and developing these enterprise applications based on the Spring framework and the J2EE platform.</p><p>Then I co-founded ChicMic wherein we developed in-house apps and games for the iOS and Android stores. We developed more than 60 games and apps and a couple of them reached the #1 rank in different stores. Also, one of our games was published by Clickgamer /Chillingo (the original publisher of ‘Angry Birds’ and ‘Cut the Rope’). In 2012, I co-founded ChicMic with the details above.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What are the key achievements of your entrepreneurial journey?</h3><ul><li>Developed world-class apps & games with 5+ million downloads</li><li>1000+ projects successfully delivered</li><li>300+ clients served with almost 99% client satisfaction</li><li>5+ apps & games ranked #1 worldwide</li><li>Worked with Fortune 50 clients and many Enterprise clients</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How do you look after your employees?

Please share your views.</h3><p>It’s a need as no two people are the same. Just as our children need constant vigilance so does our business especially since our workforce is quite young. The vision, experience, and foresight that come with experience come in handy with constant vigilance to handle things correctly before it’s too late.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>It’s a rat race out there. How do you cope with that?</h3><p>With my 19 years of experience, I have acquired the wisdom to not get into the rat race but focus on doing our work diligently and providing quality service. This eventually leads to success and also maintains a work-life balance for everyone at ChicMic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZLCptcKmoJxlkqq2rbDIp55mq52Wv7Wx0WaYqaicnrCiwMiopaw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
