 The couple in the pictures on the computer are glamorously dishevelled. He is tall, dark and handsome. She is petite and has long blonde hair. They are a positive cliche; high on gloss and high on life.

He is tall, dark and handsome. She is petite and has long blonde hair. They are a positive cliche; high on gloss and high on life. As she scrolls through the images on her screen, Judy Marks breaks into a mirthless smile. This is her life – or at least the Hollywood version, based on both her ex-husband Howard Marks’s book and her own.</p><p>The pictures are stills from Mr Nice starring Rhys Ifans as Marks and Chloe Sevigny as Judy. Only the casting seems to thrill 54-year-old Judy.<br></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/05/24/article-0-04A767240000044D-886_468x286.jpg height=286 width=468 alt="Howard Marks and Judy Marks" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>'He let me down': Judy and Marks celebrate Millennium Eve in 1999 with a joint</p><p>As for the rest, too much has changed for her to view these representations of her past life with anything other than bitter dismay. The rose-tinted picture she once painted of the notorious drug-dealer who was her husband has been firmly ground underfoot. Marks, now 63, has spent the past decade or so nurturing his status as a folk legend, lionised by thousands of ‘fans’ for a drug-smuggling life of crime which once earned him a 25-year sentence in one of America’s toughest penitentiaries (he served seven).</p><p>He has become a darling of the liberal Left who pored over The Guardian newspaper’s serialisation of his book and applaud his national speaking tour. Because the drug he smuggled was hashish – several thousand tons of the stuff – his crime was converted into some sort of pious campaign.<br></p><p>He may have had 43 aliases (one of them Mr Nice), 89 phone lines and 25 registered companies; he may have been under surveillance by the US Drug Enforcement Administration for five years in one of the most complex stings in their history; he may have owed the taxman millions and revelled in the nickname Narco Polo for his globetrotting drug-touting, but his, you see, was a ‘victimless crime’. Cannabis should be decriminalised, he argued, ‘nobody got hurt’, it was ‘the system’ that had made a victim of Marks.<br></p><p>Judy used to believe that. But now she knows it’s a lie. ‘I lived with a liar,’ she says bluntly. ‘Howard was never Robin Hood. All he ever wanted was to be famous. He’s delighted that a film of his life is being made. He’s loving it.’<br></p><p>Those drawn to watch the movie, written and directed by British screenwriter Bernard Rosen, can expect to see Ifans as a charming Welsh rogue with a resolve-weakening smile who runs rings round the authorities in the flower-power years. They can expect a happy ending of sorts – Marks’s release, return to the bosom of his family and elevation to literary deity.&nbsp;</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/05/24/article-0-050D040F000005DC-786_233x423.jpg height=423 width=233 alt="Judy Marks, ex wife of drug smuggler Howard, with son Patrick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Damaged lives: Judy Marks with son Patrick in Majorca last week</p><p>In reality, of course, the story didn’t end there.<br></p><p>Today, speaking from her home in Palma, Majorca, Judy says: ‘For years<br>I was terrified living with him. I used to beg him to stop dealing. I nagged him non-stop. We quarrelled over it. But he was unbelievably selfish. And the family was devastated, destroyed. I look back and think what an idiot I was. I regret that I wasn’t more forceful.<br></p><p>‘His own children [Amber, now 31, Francesca, 28, and Patrick, 22] got hurt. Patrick was only one when both of us were arrested. I was in prison for a year in Madrid away from the children. It was a terrible, painful time and Patrick suffered the most. A lot of people got very hurt. So no, I wouldn’t call his crimes victimless.’<br></p><p>And while Marks continues to take drugs and voice his belief that cannabis should be legal, Judy, once an advocate of that view herself, is less sure.<br></p><p>Motherhood has altered her views, whereas fatherhood seems to have left Marks’s unchallenged. She says: ‘I do wish that Howard would leave all this drugs stuff behind. It’s different these days. There needs to be more education about drugs and a different approach.<br></p><p>‘For instance, I find it alarming that people now refer to skunk as dope. People of my generation perhaps think that hash and skunk are the same thing and they’re just not. Skunk is a very different drug. It’s dangerous. It’s a worry.’<br></p><p>As she speaks, Judy looks affectionately towards Patrick, who sits half-<br>listening to his mother. There is an irony in the fact that the woman who protected and supported one of the most notorious drug dealers in the country should now speak with parental concern for her son’s generation. A generation that, under the influence of what she refers to as ‘old hippies’, is encouraged to think that skunk – an intensively grown and extra-strong drug – is harmless.</p><h1>'I discovered I had breast cancer... and he left me'</h1><p>But then, as Judy knows, none of it is harmless. Her life today and that of her youngest son Patrick is testimony to the true cost of Marks’s crimes.<br></p><p>Patrick lives with his mother. He is listless and withdrawn. He doesn’t work and it is clear in the threadbare fabric of their apartment in the once-hip, now faded neighbourhood of Terreno, that Marks’s ill-gotten gains are long gone. All that is left is the collateral damage – a mother’s fury and a youngest son’s troubles.<br></p><p>Judy and Marks split in 2003 and&nbsp; divorced in 2005. Judy had just been diagnosed with breast cancer when she discovered that Marks had been unfaithful.<br></p><p>‘You could say that he let me down, yes, just a bit,’ she says grimly. ‘If I had known what I know now would I have stood by him? Would I have waited for him and tried to bring up the children as best I could, on my own, to respect their father and believe in him? What do you think? I was just 16 when I met Howard. I was so young, so taken in, so in love. I was just a kid. What did I know then, really?’</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/05/24/article-1187009-050F8F52000005DC-70_224x423.jpg height=423 width=224 alt="Rhys Ifans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/05/24/article-1187009-00A11321000004B0-768_224x423.jpg height=423 width=224 alt="Chloe Sevigny" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Far from reality: Chloe Sevigny, who plays Judy Marks in the new film of Howard Marks' life, and Rhys Ifans, spotted in Cardiff Bay during filming. Judy says her own life was far from being picture perfect<br></p><p>Judy was the fourth of six children brought up in a middle-class family in Stafford, London and Brighton. Her mother was from Belfast, her father studied nuclear physics at Cambridge, then worked as an executive at English Electric. Marks was handsome and charismatic, a grammar school boy from a small mining town near Bridgend in Wales. He moved on to Balliol College, Oxford, where he, like Judy’s father, read physics.<br></p><p>It was when Marks began to study philosophy at postgraduate level that he started trading small quantities of hashish. It was, it seemed to him, both profitable and easy. By the time Judy met him – and fell instantly in love – at a dinner party in Brighton in 1971, Marks’s ‘career’ as a drug dealer was taking off. But, with her partnership – or more accurately with her brother Patrick Lane’s expertise – it positively bloomed. Lane was an accountant, a former trainee with Price Waterhouse. He lived in America and had been working as a money-manager for drug smugglers since 1970.<br></p><p>Judy moved in with Marks when she was 18 and for a while they lived together in Brighton. In 1974, Marks was charged with trying to smuggle cannabis into the United States in music equipment. He jumped bail and Judy and Marks went on the<br>run together.<br></p><p>Marks has described them as ‘like Bonnie and Clyde’. Certainly Judy was under his spell but she could never claim to have been under any illusions about his ‘business’, or the speed with which it became a family affair. With Patrick as the accountant, Marks placed Judy’s younger brother, George, in charge of a language school in Karachi from where he sourced some of the hashish he then smuggled.&nbsp;</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/05/24/article-1187009-04A767880000044D-64_233x387.jpg height=387 width=233 alt="Mr Nice book" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Just like Bonny and Clyde: Judy Marks' book about life with Mr Nice</p><p>In 1980 Judy and Marks married. She was five months pregnant with Francesca. Marks’s daughter Myfanwy, from a previous relationship, and their first child, Amber, were bridesmaids. The groom was on remand in Brixton prison accused of smuggling 15 tons of Colombian marijuana by boat into a remote Scottish loch. But the trial was farcical. Marks later admitted bribing a Mexican police chief to testify that he was acting as an undercover agent and threw in a claim of having worked for M16 which, much to the prosecution’s embarrassment, turned out to be true. He was acquitted but pleaded guilty to the 1974 charges from which he had fled and was sentenced to just three years. When he came out he went back to ‘work’.<br></p><p>Marks extended his business interests in the Far East, becoming an investor in full-body-massage parlours. When he had business cards printed up, describing himself as ‘Howard Marks Procurement Manager’ Judy told him it was ‘sick’, but didn’t protest any more vehemently.<br></p><p>Now, her consistent lack of protest is, one feels, an abiding regret.<br></p><p>They moved from London to Mallorca in 1984 on Patrick’s advice – prompted by the arrival of a £3million bill from the Inland Revenue. ‘We were just a very normal family in Majorca,’ Judy insists, though what she means is that they gave a very good impression of being normal – they fooled everyone. ‘Howard was the breadwinner and I was a strict parent. When he went away I became more strict, I think to compensate. If I caught Amber so much as smoking a cigarette I’d ground her.’<br></p><p>Then, in 1988, Marks and Judy were arrested after a DEA and CIA operation ended with a morning raid on their villa. Marks was charged with drug-smuggling on an epic scale, moving tons of hashish all over the world. Judy was charged with conspiracy and sentenced to 18 months in a Madrid prison.<br></p><p>Marks was extradited to the US and sentenced to 25 years in Terre Haute, Indiana, the site of America’s only Federal Death Row. Amber was ten, Francesca seven, and Patrick, the latest addition to the family, just one.<br></p><p>Judy’s younger sister Masha and her boyfriend took the children in while she served her sentence. Only later did it transpire that the boyfriend was a heroin addict who beat up Masha and often locked Patrick, soiled and neglected, in a dark room. Asked if he remembers any of those months, Patrick says simply: ‘A bit.’&nbsp;</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/05/24/article-1187009-0025EB1A1000044C-917_233x423.jpg height=423 width=233 alt="Author Howard Marks" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Destroyed: Judy Marks says her ex-husband's drug career blighted the life of his son</p><p>Whatever happened left him profoundly traumatised. When he was reunited with his mother he couldn’t talk and needed psychological care.<br></p><p>Judy admits: ‘It affected him very deeply. When Howard was in prison he was just a voice at the end of the phone to Patrick. His father wasn’t any sort of figure to him really. I have this awful memory, sweet memory, of Patrick riding past his school in a car after Howard was released and saying to Howard to stick his head out of the window as they went by and Patrick shouting, “See, I have got a dad.”’<br></p><p>Patrick blushes at the anecdote. Both of his sisters have gone on to flourish – Amber is a barrister and Francesca a philosophy graduate and yoga teacher. But life, for Patrick, seems to have been derailed before it ever began.<br></p><p>It is clear that he would dearly love to have a relationship with his father better than the ‘bloody awful’ one that he has – as Judy puts it. At one point in our interview, out of the blue, Patrick says: ‘You know my father dedicated Mr Nice to me?’ When asked why only him, Patrick blinks and explains: ‘Well, he missed half my life. The least he could do was dedicate a book to me.’<br></p><p>Patrick says he would like to be an actor and that he enjoyed the two occasions on which he and his mother were on set while Mr Nice was being filmed in Alicante. But, in a quiet moment, Judy admits that the experience on set left her ‘very, very angry with Howard’.<br></p><p>She explains: ‘Patrick had been looking forward to seeing his father [who lives in Wales and London] so much – he hadn’t seen him for eight months and when we turned up Howard was off his head, drunk and God knows what. He’d been drinking for three, four days. He couldn’t even remember seeing Patrick.<br>‘He’s a bloody awful father.’</p><h1>'Howard turned up off his head and drunk'</h1><p>Two years ago Patrick had major back surgery to correct a curvature of the spine thought to be related to an accident he had as a four-year-old when, Judy says, he ‘fell off a building on to concrete’. Rehabilitation has been long and painful.<br>Patrick admits that he has ‘mixed feelings’ about the new film. Slowly he articulates them: ‘I want the good bits and the bad bits to be shown but I don’t want somebody else to play me. I don’t want a stranger to interpret my life. I want to go back to when I was eight years old.’<br></p><p>The comment hangs in the air.<br></p><p>Patrick was eight when his father was released from prison. He doesn’t want to watch a stranger portray what must have been the happiest time of his life. He wants to relive<br>it himself. The sad reality is that<br>the years that followed have fallen far short of that eight-year-old’s giddy expectations.<br></p><p>Each family member has a cameo role in the film. Marks thought it would be ‘fun’. But sitting with Judy and Patrick, it seems that Marks has relegated his family to bit-part players in their own lives – lives that he would no doubt characterise as ‘fun’ but which have left Patrick and, one suspects, his mother wishing that they could do it again, do it differently or perhaps not do it at all.<br></p><p>Howard Marks could not be contacted last night.</p><p>• In an earlier version of this story we said Howard Marks had fathered a child outside his marriage to Judy which led to their divorce in 2005. We are happy to make clear this was not the case.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6Gybn2QcW5paGlkmrN5raKanmV9pL%2Bmecuiop5lfad6osPFrqNmnpGptaa%2BjGZkfrBdrLansYydqa6fXai6trPGpZyrZXikxKK%2Bw2aEmqqbqHq1sculqmaclajBs7vYnptmnpGitq3FjaGrpqQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
