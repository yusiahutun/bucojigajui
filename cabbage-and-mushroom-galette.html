Halfway between a tart and pizza, I think they’re easier than both. They don’t require any of the eggs or liquid-setting bake of a quiche and there’s less of a volume limitation than you have with pizza, where too many ingredients will send your toppings right onto the oven floor. The galette is perfection, and I am excited to add this one to the collection.</p><p><a href=# title=shiitakes><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3167/2970447114_8254846a60_z.jpg alt=shiitakes data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>It comes from Deborah Madison’s <a href=#>Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone</a>, a book so beloved by <a href=#>so many food bloggers</a>, I am deeply ashamed to admit that I have had for almost a year and (whispers) this is the first recipe I have made from it. However, it also the first recipe I bookmarked when I hoisted it up onto my desk the very first time all of those months ago; and I think what had me putting it off was my uncertainty over some of the elements. Did I want to try her yeasted galette dough when I had one I love, love love? (I didn’t.) Would I really want to make horseradish sauce from scratch? (I tried and failed, but that story for another time.) I love galettes as a weekday night meal, and yet it barely seemed like it could be pulled off.</p><p><a href=# title="hard-boiled egg"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3054/2975693310_d78796644e_z.jpg alt="hard-boiled egg" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>And yet it was. I was really surprised at how quickly this came together, and the taste so far exceeded my expectations, I rightfully kicked myself for not trying it sooner. Learn from my mistakes, people! This one is good as gold.</p><p><a href=# title="cabbage and mushroom galette"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm3.static.flickr.com/2368/2970449856_2abfaa3b1b_z.jpg alt="cabbage and mushroom" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><b>Galettes, previously:</b> <a href=#>Wild Mushroom and Stilton</a> and <a href=#>Butternut Squash and Caramelized Onion</a></p><p><b>Two years ago:</b> <a href=#>Pumpkin Muffins</a></p><p><b>Cabbage and Mushroom Galette with Horseradish Sauce</b><br>Filling adapted from <a href=#>Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone</a>; Galette dough is an old favorite</p><p><u>For the pastry</u><br>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour<br>1/4 teaspoon salt<br>8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into<br>pieces<br>1/4 cup sour cream<br>2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice<br>1/4 cup ice water</p><p><u>For the filling</u><br>2 tablespoons butter<br>1 large onion, finely diced<br>4 ounces fresh shiitake mushrooms, stems discarded, caps thinly diced<br>1 teaspoon chopped thyme or 1/2 teaspoon dried<br>1 teaspoon chopped tarragon or 1/2 teaspoon dried<br>1 tablespoon chopped dill or 1 teaspoon dried<br>6 cups thinly sliced cabbage, preferably Savoy, or 4 cups cabbage plus 2 cups other greens, such as beet, chard, or kale<br>salt and freshly milled pepper<br>1/4 cup chopped parsley<br>1 hard-cooked egg, chopped<br>1/4 cup sour cream or yogurt<br>1 teaspoon tarragon vinegar<br>2 tablespoons melted butter</p><p><u>For the horseradish sauce</u><br>1/4 cup prepared horseradish<br>1 cup yogurt or sour cream</p><p>1. Make pastry: In a bowl, combine the flour and salt. Place the butter in another bowl. Place both bowls in the freezer for 1 hour. Remove the bowls from the freezer and make a well in the center of the flour. Add the butter to the well and, using a pastry blender, cut it in until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Make another well in the center. In a small bowl, whisk together the sour cream, lemon juice and water and add half of this mixture to the well. With your fingertips, mix in the liquid until large lumps form. Remove the large lumps and repeat with the remaining liquid and flour-butter mixture. Pat the lumps into a ball; do not overwork the dough. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.</p><p>2. Prepare the filling: Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, mushrooms, and herbs and cook until softened, about 10 minutes. Add the cabbage, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 cup water. Cover and cook slowly until the cabbage is tender, 15 to 20 minutes, turning it occasionally. Add more liquid. When tender, uncover and raise the heat to evaporate any excess moisture. The mixture should be fairly dry. Stir in the parsley, egg, and sour cream. Season with vinegar and taste for salt and pepper.</p><p>3. Assemble galette: Preheat the oven to 400» F. Roll the dough into a large thin circle and set it on the back of a sheet pan or cookie sheet. The edges will hang over the sides. Add the filling, making a mound 7 to 8 inches across, then fold the edges over and brush with the melted butter. Pour any extra butter into the vegetables. Bake until browned, 25 to 30 minutes. While it is baking, mix the horseradish and cream to form a sauce, and season to taste. When galette is done, carefully slide it onto a serving plate. Serve with the horseradish sauce on the side.</p><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-1011 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-1011 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
