She meant red. Bright, bold red.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My mother had an almost religious belief in the power of red lipstick to alter your life. Growing up poor in the Bronx with deaf parents who didn’t speak English or know any sign language, she had to advocate for her family from a very early age. She grappled with government agencies, teachers, and landlords on her own and had to exude confidence to ensure she was seen and heard. By the time she was 16, she had a ritual: She squared her shoulders, applied a deep-red lipstick, and stepped out into the world. She wore red lipstick when she went to work right after high school and while she took night classes, determined to get an education. Eventually, she married and traveled the globe, but red lipstick remained her talisman, a signal to herself and the world that she was worthy of attention. And when, in her 60s, she went in for cataract surgery, she painted her lips before being wheeled away, certain the doctors would pay extra care. The first thing she said in recovery: “All the nurses love my lipstick.”</p><img alt="red lip effect harper's bazaar april 2023 beauty feature" title="red lip effect harper's bazaar april 2023 beauty feature" width=1500 height=1875 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz040123btyopener-023-wm-6436cdc10f5d2.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Photographer: Louise and Maria Thornfeldt ;Fashion editor: Miguel Enamorado; Model: Anne V; hair: Tsuki for Redken; makeup: Marcelo Gutierrez for Dior Beauty; casting: Anita Bitton at the Establishment</span><p>Miu Miu dress, $3,900; miumiu.com.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My mother knew instinctively what numerous researchers have shown.

The suffragette movement and the military in the 1940s were largely segregated. For women of color during that period, wearing red lipstick could mean running the risk of drawing unwanted attention.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“While I don’t think we have fully arrived, I do think things have improved,” says Alex Klein, who launched the company <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://wyrl.beauty/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="WYRL (Wear Your Red Lips) Beauty " class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">WYRL (Wear Your Red Lips) Beauty </a>with three red lipsticks that work for all skin tones. “As a Black woman, my aha moment came from saying no to the idea that wearing red lipstick was unsafe or would send the wrong signal.

Ruby Stain was the result, and Carolyn loved it. It became her trademark shade.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My mother continued to wear red lipstick her entire adult life. After a series of falls immobilized her, she spent her last months in a rehab center on Manhattan’s Upper East Side.

When I got to my mother’s room, the physical therapists were gathered by her bed. They told me how they admired my mother’s fierce optimism and felt honored that she put on lipstick to see them every day. When they left and my cousin Jimmy and I were alone with my mother, waiting for my daughter to arrive, he turned to me and said, “We have to send her out with her lipstick on.” And so we did.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Later that week, at my mother’s shiva, her friends laughed and traded stories about her determination, resilience, and gift for reinvention.
