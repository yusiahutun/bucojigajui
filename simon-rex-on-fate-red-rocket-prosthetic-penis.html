"And at that point, after we won the Spirit Award, I said, 'It's time to tell people.' We did this for eight months. We somehow got away with it for eight months.

Rex first rose to popularity as a Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein model in the 1990s. He went on to have roles in film and television, including the "Scary Movie" franchise.</p><p>"It's been very surreal, because we've all been living in this strange time together, in this 'Twilight Zone' pandemic, strange times collectively that we're all in," he explained to the publication. "So if you add, on top of that, this amazing highlight of my career, it just adds to the weirdness of it all."</p><p>"Sometimes I just start laughing. I'll be in a hotel room by myself and I just start cracking up because it's kind of like, life is just a big cosmic joke. And how is this happening now? And I still think I'm just reeling from it all," Simon noted.</p><a id=gallery-link-a9a99830-cc1e-44f8-8829-f4adae0b262c class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:a9a99830-cc1e-44f8-8829-f4adae0b262c data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:e5bf9488-989f-4c59-948a-171ceadd0a24 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/7f/4by3/2022/03/21/7f613423291b45238d74f0c937c462d5_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j2xma2lfqLauu81mqZ6wXaS7brLArZxmqpWZerO7wqScrWWgp7y0wMeeq6KbXaWyr7XSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
