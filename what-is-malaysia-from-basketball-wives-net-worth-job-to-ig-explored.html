However, as per her Instagram bio, it looks as though she’s moved on from jewellery in 2021.</p><p>The mother-of-three, whose real name is Laquisha, has a clothing store named Vanity World. The shop sells active wear, dresses, co-ords and more.</p><p>It’s likely that this is where some of Malaysia’s earnings come from. However, the reality star also makes a living from appearing on Basketball Wives, too. A 2021 report from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Sun</a> states that: “It was reported in the early days that the ladies took home $7,500 per episode“.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=meet-malaysia-on-instagram>Meet Malaysia on Instagram</h3><p>Raised in Compton, California, Malaysia has an Instagram following of 2.7m.
