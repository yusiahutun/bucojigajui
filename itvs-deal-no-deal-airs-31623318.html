"Do you know what?" he asked Stephen. "If it comes down to £100,000 and a penny - you're only here once." Tom, on the other, hand said he would be the opposite, as he jokingly screamed: "Just take the money!"</p><p>Reece's first round showed a sign of things to come as he immediately picked out a number of the higher-value red boxes, prompting the banker to offer him paltry sums not worth considering.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31600345.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_THIS-MORNING-main-2.jpg><p>The game continued in much the same vein until there were five boxes - a time in the show that saw the banker somewaht generously offer £8,400 despite Reece's bad luck. However, the plucky contestant continued, citing enough money for a holiday in New York and a new car as the goal for his endeavours.</p><p>And so, choosing to play on, it all boiled down to the contents of the final two boxes - 1p and £5,000, with the banker offering a deal of £2,650. Then, much to Reece's shock, his partner Tom encouraged him to gamble - only for it all to end in tears as Reece became the first person to leave with a penny since the programme relaunched in its new home.</p><p>Stephen said: "Listen its a good job you collect coins", before presenting him with a 1p coin from his pocket emblazoned with his own face. Reece replied: "Oh, thank you very much."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p><b>Have you joined Threads?

One user pondered: "Why turn down £8,400 when there's 1p on the table? It makes great telly but it's bloody vicious too. #DealOrNoDeal" A nother commented: "Sadly Reece’s box contained just 1p but well done anyway Reece you were so brave and I think you should have dealt on £8,400 and New York and a car was a lovely idea you have been a great player and all the best for the future :)."</p><p>A third added: "And he becomes the first member of the 1p club. Silly boy but he does like collecting coins. #DealOrNoDeal." A fourth tried offer a positive, writing: "If your gonna lose ,atleast he will be talked about for ages ,he started the 1p club #DealOrNoDeal." And a fifth agreed: "Worth it just for the 1p club coin! That’s a rare item! Reece played the game and that’s what it’s all about. #DealOrNoDeal."</p><p><b>For more of the latest showbiz and TV news from the Daily Star, make sure you sign up for one of our newsletters </b><a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#><b>here</b></a><b>.</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKymZLa1wtJmm56ZnGK7sHnDnpilZZGev7R5kmpta2tjZoU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
