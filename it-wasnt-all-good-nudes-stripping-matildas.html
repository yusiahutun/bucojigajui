The Joeys, many of whom are already playing in Europe despite still being in their teens, showed defensive savvy and proficiency in attack against Brazil in the Under-17 final in New Zealand and lost out in the cruellest possible way, penalties."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

A group of female footballers take off their kit for the camera, put the pin-up poses in a calendar, run off 40,000 or so copies, just to be on the safe side, call a press conference and let the testosterone factor do the rest.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Of course, everything was done in the best possible taste. It was not a case of sex sells or cashing in on nudity. No, no.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'Not many people knew that Australian women's soccer makes its Olympic debut next year,' said a spokesman, yes, a man, for the team.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'Now everybody will know who they are.' And, presumably, rush along to the games and wait in anticipation for the ritual swapping of shirts. But that does not worry the Matildas, either.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One said: 'People have talked about attracting undesirable people but I don't know what an undesirable person in a crowd is.' Ugh.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But, wait, the calendar has not been all good nudes for women's soccer.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Australian Olympic Committee have got their knickers in a twist, not about the women taking theirs off, but over the use of the sacred word 'Olympic' on the calendar's cover.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Subtitling the publication 2000 Olympic Year Calendar was a no-no, seemingly - you have to pay up front to use the word Olympic on items ranging from tea mugs to golf tees - and the Australian Women's Soccer Association has agreed to blur the naughty bits on the next print run.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">You would have thought the Olympic people would have welcomed the publicity and being part of the fun.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The marketing people for the 2002 World Cup mascots, which were unveiled the day after the Matildas, might need a bit of help pushing the 'futuristic, computer-animated' characters.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They are nude, too, and translucent but the Atmos family are far from loveable.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sure, computer game obsessed Japanese are weaned on cartoon characters and Hello Kitty is a national treasure, but these guys look revolting.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Their only hope is doing a deal with the Matildas to guest in their next calendar. It's a win-win situation, with the Atmos' gaining street cred and the Aussie girls being entitled to use that other magic marketing phrase, the World Cup.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdjZX54g5BooK1lp5bAr8CMmqOlZZekvKV5za6bnqtdqMGztc%2BpoKefXaKutbXLnZis</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
