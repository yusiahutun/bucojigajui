Rucker joins me on this week's episode of Taste of Country Nights, On Demand, and we dive into the deep-rooted meaning behind his album, but we also share many laughs. We talked about the most personal song on the record — it's a doozy — but also which '90s acts that were popular alongside Hootie & the Blowfish party the hardest."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Rucker acknowledges that, yeah, it can be hard to get top-name artists to perform at weddings. Then, he asked:</p><p>"Do you know what my wedding price is?"</p><p>I felt like he was baiting me, so I asked him to tell me. The response? A million dollars — no, he's not kidding, and yes, he's worth it, if you ask him.</p><p>"I'll be the best wedding band you ever had," Rucker insists. "I will kill it. You can even name five songs and we'll learn."</p><p>Far-fetched as it may sound, people take him up on that cost — "twice," he confirms.</p><p>"And we played our butts off — we were great! I sang the wedding song, then we go play the show."</p><p>I wondered what the protocol&nbsp;is for that: Can the couple and guests put pictures and videos from the performance online to share with the world?&nbsp;At that price, he cheekily responds,&nbsp;"You can do whatever you want to do."</p><p>In the absence of weddings to play, Rucker is currently on his<a href=#> world tour</a>, which&nbsp;extends through the middle of May 2024.</p><p>Evan Paul is the host of&nbsp;<a class="x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0" title="Original URL: https://tasteofcountry.com/category/taste-of-country-nights/.
