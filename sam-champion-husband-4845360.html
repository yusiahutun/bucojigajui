They first got engaged that October and told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The New York Time</a>s about their official wedding plans. “We’re getting married New Year’s Eve in Miami,” Sam told the outlet at the time. And of course, they kept their promise! Sam and Rubem first got married in New York City, and then they hosted a New Year’s Eve wedding bash in Miami Beach. Their Miami wedding was a full-circle moment for the adorable pair since that is where they first met in 2009, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The US Sun</a>. Sam and his artist husband met in the beach city of Florida during New Year’s Eve just three years before getting married in the same place!</p><h2>Rubem Is An Artist</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Although Sam has a very successful career in TV journalism, his partner has an inspiring career as well. Rubem is a successful artist that works as a photographer and a sculptor. His artwork often has important political messages about climate change and LGBT rights. Rubem can often be seen working on his beautiful artworks on his <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>official Instagram</a> where he has over 22K followers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sam-Champion-Rubem-Robierb-husband-shuttr-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>The creative man <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shared a video</a> on Instagram on July 4, 2022, and it shows him painting a beautiful butterfly. He captioned the post, “#contemporaryart #energy #manifestation #multiverse.” And working on his art is not something he does alone! Sam can often be seen giving a helping hand from time to time. On Aug. 2, 2022, Rubem shared a video of Sam helping out with a life-size butterfly sculpture with his husband. Rubem captioned the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>adorable video</a>, “Who has the most supportive husband? @samchampion.”</p><h2>They Both Like To Travel</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>When Sam isn’t reporting on the weather and Rubem is not working on his art, the power duo can often be seen traveling the world together. Both of their Instagrams are filled with many wonderful memories of their adventurous trips. In August 2022, the loving couple took a trip to Rio de Janeiro, a beach city in Brazil. Sam <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shared a video</a> of the holiday on his Instagram, and admired the beach life. He wrote, “One of the beautiful things about&nbsp;#Rio&nbsp;is the design of the&nbsp;#beachlife ! Wide views, wide bike paths, wide running paths along a wide beach!! It’s planned for people to enjoy #allday&nbsp;#bringcoffee&nbsp;#bomdia&nbsp;#praia&nbsp;#gostoso.” No matter what these two are up to, one can be sure it is always filled with art and adventure!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9KapGabmJa6sbXOp2ShraOXrq%2BwjG1vbW1ja31w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
