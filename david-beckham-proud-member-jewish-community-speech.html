During the public conversation with producer Ben Winston, the former Manchester United star noted: "I am part of the Jewish community and I am proud to say it."</p><p id=e3_izK3JoBJ data-wc=86>Touching on his family’s bloodline, in particular that of his maternal grandfather, her also said: “My grandfather always made sure we would keep up with certain traditions. We went to bar mitzvahs and weddings and I would wear a kippah. Every Saturday morning, I used to go to see my grandfather – you’d walk in the house to my grandmother preparing chicken soup and matzah balls and latkes. We always kept to those traditions, it was always about the family coming together and spending time together."</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=ebMnBndQb-5 data-wc=22>During the discussion hosted in front of 700 shul attendees, David also tested out his language skills, reading a prayer in Hebrew.</p><p id=e6W7v2v_bQi data-wc=46>Over the years, we have seen Judaism become a core part of the Beckham’s family life.
