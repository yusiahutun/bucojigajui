The creative producer for Tiktok Southeast Asia’s music department started her egg freezing journey in February last year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I love what I do so, of course, I did not want to rush into anything but you know, a lot of Asian parents would push for marriage because you need to have a child because ‘time is running out’,” she told This Week in Asia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The process for Peterson took about two months. After receiving hormonal injections, 20 of her eggs were collected in April last year for storage. The procedure cost US$5,000 and she also has to pay a yearly storage fee of up to US$300.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Pricey procedures</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite the technology being around since the 1980s, egg freezing doesn’t come cheap. It remains a process available only to wealthier women, especially in Southeast Asia where the average GDP per capita was just US$11,123 in 2020, according to World Bank data.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In South Korea, where women have had access to the process for more than a decade, business owner Lee Mi-young, 36, said she and her husband paid around 6 million to 7 million won (US$4,900-US$5,700) on the two occasions she had her eggs frozen.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Japan, the procedure costs about US$4,800 to US$5,800, in Taiwan US$4,400, and in Indonesia US$3,500. It used to cost as much as US$6,000 to have your eggs frozen in Thailand, but in recent years prices there have fallen to around US$3,000 depending on the number of eggs and duration of storage.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">Women are focusing on work and less on family. So some have decided to freeze eggs for the futureDr Poonkiat Punyamitr, Prime Fertility Clinic Bangkok</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Dr Poonkiat Punyamitr, medical director of Prime Fertility Clinic in Bangkok, said the technology to freeze eggs had been available in Thailand for about 15 years but was mostly used by women with medical issues such as ovarian cancer in the past. Now, the procedure has become increasingly popular among wealthy, urban Thai women, he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Its popularity spread as women’s lives have changed. They are focusing on work and less on family. So some have decided to freeze eggs for the future,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kim Chung-hoon, director of M Fertility Centre in the affluent Gangnam district of the South Korean capital, likewise noted that egg freezing had become increasingly popular – with women in the country inspired to go ahead with a procedure that high-profile celebrities such as television personality Sayuri Fujita and actress Ham So-won have also undergone.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Most of the women who came to consult me in the past were in their forties, but the past four to five years I’ve seen a drastic rise in women in their 30s who want their eggs frozen,” Kim said. “I see about 20 to 30 patients a month who are interested in freezing their eggs.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/04/15/302a3a17-b307-42ba-bc31-09a3153b5454_6c7d3edc.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At CHA Fertility Centre, one of the biggest clinics of its type in South Korea, the number of women who underwent egg freezing rose from just 42 in 2014 to 635 in 2018, the Joongang newspaper reported.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The average age that women in South Korea marry and have their first child has also increased in recent years, with most opting to do both after the age of 30, according to the latest UN World Fertility Report.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Malaysia, TMC Fertility Centre chief executive officer Irene Kwan said egg freezing used to be out of the reach of most Malaysian women and “not their top priority”, but that was changing now more were aware of the process. Some clinics even offer women the option of paying in instalments to make the process more accessible, she said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Woman who thought Chinese sperm donor was Japanese sues for US$2.9 million</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Not all women choose to get their eggs frozen in their home country, either. Pre-pandemic, Thai fertility clinics were used by women from across the Asia-Pacific, with some Singaporeans heading to Australia like Sia did, while others opted for Malaysia and even Spain. Kim said the foreign patients he sees include Koreans who have emigrated to the United States or Europe.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Medical costs are five to 10 times cheaper here than in the US while accessibility to hospitals is also much better,” said Kim, who worked in the US for two years. “And a handful of our clinics here are comparatively superior, or on the same level, as the top clinics anywhere else in the world in terms of the success rate of pregnancy.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Unused eggs</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While more women are undoubtedly freezing their eggs now than in the past, a question mark still hangs over how much of a dent this makes in arresting falling fertility rates if the eggs are never fertilised.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Poonkiat said less than 10 per cent of the women who use his clinic in Bangkok return for their eggs, while Kim said only about 5 per cent of the eggs frozen at M Fertility Centre had been fertilised so far.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Part of the reason for this is the fact that most countries in the region that allow egg freezing also stipulate that they can only be fertilised by a woman’s legal spouse. In South Korea and Malaysia, this rule even applies to foreigners.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For the past two years, cohabiting couples in South Korea have been classified as married for the purposes of fertilising frozen eggs, but in Malaysia a religious edict prevents single Muslim women from even getting their eggs frozen – they must be legally married before they can do so.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/04/15/a230c35d-ab18-476c-9af0-a9f9512e20f1_d8cac2a8.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When Singapore announced it would allow single women to freeze their eggs, it came with a statement from the social and family development ministry that the government “encourages parenthood within marriage”. It said it did not support “planned and deliberate parenthood by singles”, calling it a “lifestyle choice”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">National University of Singapore sociologist Tan Ern Ser said he was not surprised by such requirements, “as it is consistent with social norms, backed up by public policy, of having children only within a legally sanctioned marriage”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The government has stood by its long-held position that the “family is the basic building block of society”, in reference to heterosexual married couples – even as divorce rates have risen and LGBT families have become more visible in recent years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“A close-knit, strong and stable family provides for the care and development of its members and is self-reliant,” the social and family development ministry says in a statement on its website.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Singapore upholds anti-gay law but activists have reason to be hopeful</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Aware, which has lobbied for years for unmarried and married women to be given equal treatment by the government, said it was disappointed by the exclusionary nature of the egg-freezing policy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hingorani from the group said it leaves out single women who wish to become mothers and lesbian or bisexual women in committed relationships who likewise want to be parents. “We’re disappointed that the state continues to employ narrow definitions of a family nucleus, that is a married father and mother, and their children.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This same “narrow definition” is why Singaporean women like Sia said they chose to have their eggs frozen elsewhere. She said it was “pretty frustrating” to have such restrictions. Sia and her partner plan to head to Melbourne later in the year to retrieve and use the eggs she had frozen.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Poonkiat from the Bangkok fertility clinic said Thailand’s government should also re-examine its regulations on egg freezing and egg donations if it wanted to boost fertility rates. The country currently only allows married women to become egg donors, and then only if they have their husband’s permission.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">It’s not a crime to have a child outside wedlock, but it’s not officially sanctionedTan Ern Ser, National University of Singapore sociologist</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Singapore sociologist Tan called for public policy to focus on children’s welfare, regardless of parentage and method of conception.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The fact is that it’s not a crime to have a child outside wedlock, but it’s not officially sanctioned, and will therefore involve certain disadvantages for the mother and child,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“After all, [the child] is innocent and can’t be held responsible for whatever has led to his or her landing on planet Earth.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZLmqssSsq7KklWKwtrjTrqmeZ5Gnwaqvy55mbGlnaYB4hY6sppyhkaF6prPGZp2rnZWvtq%2BzjKygp5%2BRpbyzsYyfpqWkn6zAbr%2FOrquhZZukv6at</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
