However, she found joy as an aunt, commenting in 2021: "Being an aunt is one of the biggest blessings in my life. My niece and nephew bring so much joy and happiness to everyone in our family. They are wise beyond their years and are some of the best teachers, constantly teaching me new things."</p><p id=eqSSJ31H4l data-wc=51>Arriving at her wedding, &nbsp;Tatiana was breathtaking in an ivory Angel Sanchez gown with a chantilly lace overlay, teamed with a matching bolero and full-length veil.
