As a baby, Millie was partially deaf in her left ear, and within years, she would eventually lose all of her hearing in that ear. But the young star never let her hearing loss get in the way of pursuing a career as an actress. After initially relocating to Bournemouth, England at the age of four, Millie and her family settled down across the pond in Orlando, Florida when she was eight years old, where she began to follow her dream of stardom.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/stranger-things.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sadie-sink-hair.png><p>Her first foray into film and television came when she was only nine years old, when she booked a guest-starring role in the ABC fantasy drama Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, a spin-off of Once Upon a Time, in 2013.

In 2017, Millie was nominated for Oustanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series and Oustanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series at the Primetime Emmy Awards and Screen Actors Guild Awards, respectively. She ended up taking home a SAG Award that year alongside the rest of her cast, who were nominated for Oustanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series.

Come on!” trying to find the full list,” she said of the nominees. “And then finally my publicist called me and told me. I was just in shock. I thought she was going to call saying, “Ah, better luck next time,” or something like that. But she said congratulations.” The young actress went on to add of Stranger Things,&nbsp;“I’m so happy for the show. The show completely deserves it. The show is 10 times more amazing than my nomination.”</p><h2>What is Millie Bobby Brown’s Enola Holmes salary?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/millie-bobby-brown-3.png><p>How much does Millie Bobby Brown make from Enola Holmes? Millie has starred as Enola Holmes, the teenage sister of the already-famous Sherlock Holmes, in two Enola Holmes movies: 2020’s Enola Holmes and 2022’s Enola Holmes 2. She was also an executive producer on both movies. According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Millie made $6.1 million for the first Enola Holmes movie, with an additional $500,000 as an executive producer and $800,000 in bonuses based on streaming performance. <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> reported in 2022 that Millie made a flat $10 million for Enola Holmes 2.</p><p>In an interview with Deadline in 2022, Millie explained how her relationship with Henry Cavill in Enola Holmes 2 differed from her relationship with Stranger Things co-stars like Noah Schnapp and Charlie Heaton. “It’s different because I grew up with Noah and Charlie. I met them when I was 10. So, for me, it does feel like your schoolmates. And with Henry, it feels like a real adult relationship. Like a really good friendship, a really healthy one,” she said. “One that we have terms and conditions. I know Henry. He has terms and conditions with me. I’m not allowed to ask about his personal life. It’s like, ‘Millie, shut up. No.’ And I’m like ‘Understood.’ Whereas with the Stranger Things kids, it’s different. There’s no boundaries because it’s like we’re all siblings. But with Henry, he’s very strict with me, which I appreciate.”</p><p>She also told the magazine about how she relates to Enola’s feeling about being “undermined” in her career. “I think we are progressing slowly as a united front. But I think the industry can easily have its faults and its great accomplishments. This is one of them. Yes, of course I’ve been undermined in the past, but we don’t focus on those things. We focus on the positives, and I have not been undermined in this situation. I was given an opportunity to be a female lead in a film. And that is a step forward,” she said. Millie further opened up about what she’s learned from the Enola Holmes franchise, which was her first time in a leading role. “The dedication to the film is unlike all of us put together. So yes, it does come down to performance, but it also very much comes down to directing and being able to have a connection with your director,” she said. “It’s a dream come true.As for me, I learned many things, because I’m an upcoming young woman and that is a real learning curve for me. This is a very big pivotal moment within my career and my life. This is the first role I’ve really led.”</p><h2>What is Millie Bobby Brown’s net worth?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/millie-bobby-brown-4.png><p>So, what’s Millie Bobby Brown’s net worth?
