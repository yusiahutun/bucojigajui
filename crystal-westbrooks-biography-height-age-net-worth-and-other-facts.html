For every member of her dear family, the family is not just an important thing, it is everything.</p><p>They are called the “First Family of Social Media” and are usually compared to the Kardashians because their reality show “The Westbrooks” is similar to “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” (KUWTK). They are even called Black Kardashians. But they have said in interviews that apart from the show, which is a reality show that shows the lives of the five sisters, there is nothing else they have in common with the Kardashian series.</p><p>The random videos of the sisters, which their father put on the Internet, attracted the attention of various production houses. They were approached by a number of producers who expressed their intention to make a television series based on the girls, possibly one similar to the Kardashians.</p><p>Finally, they reached an agreement with BET Networks, where the show premiered in October 2015. After the series, the sisters explained the differences between them and the KUWTKs. This includes the fact that they come from a black family, are not glamorous, and grew up in Compton. One of the disparity characteristics is that they neither eat in Beverly Hills nor drive up in Bentleys.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Larry Nance Jr. Mom, Dad, Girlfriend, Height, Age, Ethnicity, Bio</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Crystal Westbrooks Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Crystal is not just about beauty and fame, she has a functioning brain with an entrepreneurial streak.
