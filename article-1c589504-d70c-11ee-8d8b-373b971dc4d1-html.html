A resident of Laurel, Jacque was born March 26, 1957, to Phyllis LeGasse and James Burr Johnston of Shubuta. She was the youngest of five daughters. Jacque often shared stories with her children of her wonderful childhood growing up in Shubuta. Her youth was filled with swimming at Lake Waukaway, activities at the Shubuta United Methodist Church, Ole Miss football, school activities, but especially horses. It was at an early age she discovered her love of horses which led to her becoming an accomplished equestrian.</p><p>After graduating from Wayne Academy, she attended Jones County Junior College for a year, where she was a cheerleader and an honor student. From there, along with her horse, she attended the University of Mississippi, where she received bachelor’s, master’s and specialist degrees in education.&nbsp;At Ole Miss she was a member of the Phi Mu sorority.</p><p>She was a well-loved elementary school teacher for more than 35 years, teaching in Amory, Denver, Mobile, Ala., and Waynesboro, Laurel and Jones County. She ended her career working with gifted students in the Star Reach program. To do this, she returned to school at the University of Southern Mississippi to receive an additional degree.&nbsp;She was a lifelong learner.</p><p>Jacque was an exceptional gardener who found joy in working in the dirt to the result of a yard filled with beauty. She cherished her North Park neighbors and friends. She was a devoted daughter, who in her parents’ later years lovingly helped them maintain their independence in Shubuta prior to moving to assisted living in Laurel. However, most of all, her greatest joy was being a mother to her children Julie and James and a grandmother to Lyda and Frances,&nbsp;who affectionately called her “Butter.”</p><p>Jacque was preceded in death by her grandmother and namesake Lyda Brashier Johnston, and her parents.&nbsp;</p><p>She is survived by her children Julie Pyatt (Thomas) Crockett of Washington, D.C., and James Pyatt of Austin, Texas; her granddaughters Lyda Ann Crockett and Frances June Crockett of Washington; her sisters Phyllis Ann (Kenny) Van Rossum of Laurel, Jean (Joe) Johnson of Laurel, and Hope (Frank) Johnston and Jimmye (Andy) Sweat of Jackson; and several nieces and nephews.</p><p>A celebration of life service will be at noon Friday, March 1,&nbsp;at Laurel First Methodist Church, with her nephew&nbsp;Luke Johnson and the Rev. Dr. Daniel Hathorne&nbsp;officiating. Burial will follow in Shubuta Cemetery next to her parents. The family will receive friends at the church&nbsp;from 11a.m. until noon prior to the service.&nbsp;In lieu of flowers, memorials may be made to the&nbsp;Lauren Rogers Museum of Art.</p><p>To sign the online guestbook, visit <a href=#><span>www.memorychapellaurel.com</span></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKeSnsG2rdGinKxnmpawssHEpbCnZZyusaJ5yaifp6ukpLtwrdGtoJyklZR%2BpIGXcmxpbF2ZhHGvjGponp1dbbF5roxsbmyaaWx%2Bpa%2BTnWhnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
