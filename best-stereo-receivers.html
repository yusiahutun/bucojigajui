Assuming you've already got a set of speakers, you need to <a href=#>make sure your receiver is capable of driving them properly</a>, or you might end up blowing the speakers out. If you're shopping for both speakers and a receiver at the same time, keep this in mind when choosing each.</p><p>Next up is how you'll be connecting everything. This doesn't just mean matching the type of <a href=#>cables and connectors between your receiver and speakers</a>. You also have to keep in mind what playback devices you'll be connecting and how you'll be using them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One area that is especially important to consider is whether you're hooking up a <a href=#>turntable</a>. These typically have lower output than most other devices like CD players or Blu-ray players, and they often need either a receiver with a phono input or a <a href=#>preamp</a> to bring up the volume.</p><p>Wireless connectivity is another significant point to consider. This includes <a href=#>Bluetooth</a>, which is handy if you want to listen to music from your phone. It's not just Bluetooth, though, as some receivers support Wi-Fi or Ethernet, letting you stream directly from Spotify and others.</p><p>Some stereo receivers also support multiroom or <a href=#>whole-home audio</a>. Most often in stereo receivers, this will be in the form of A and B speaker outputs, which let you connect two sets of speakers to a single receiver. Some higher-end models also feature wireless multiroom audio.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Something else that may be important to you is the overall profile of the receiver. If you're placing the receiver on an open desktop or shelf, this won't matter. That said, if you're placing the receiver in a home theater cabinet or similar enclosure, you may want to opt for a low-profile model for a better fit.</p><p>Finally, not everyone needs a receiver in the traditional sense, meaning it has a radio built-in. A few of our picks are technically <a href=#>integrated amplifiers</a>, as they don't feature a radio.</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><td colspan=3 style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p><strong>How Did We Research</strong></p></td></tr><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>Models Evaluated</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>Hours Researched</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>Reviews Analyzed</p></td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>16</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>4.5</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>22</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>How-To Geek's product recommendations come from the same team of experts that have helped people fix their gadgets over one billion times.

The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Sony STR-DH190</a> fills that role perfectly, with support for all sorts of playback and 100 Watts of solid, powerful sound. It's not cheap, but it's also far more affordable than many receivers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The STR-DH190 features four inputs, one of which is a phono input, letting you plug in your turntable if you own one. There is also a line output, which you can use for a subwoofer with a suitable <a href=#>crossover</a>. You can also use this for hooking up a digital audio recorder or even a cassette deck.</p><p>It doesn't stop at wired connections. The STR-DH190 also features support for Bluetooth, letting you play music wirelessly from your phone or tablet. Even better, the receiver supports Bluetooth Standby, which automatically powers on the receiver when you start streaming music.</p><p>The STR-DH190 also supports separate A and B speaker outputs. This means if you want to hook up a second set of speakers in a separate room for <a href=#>wired multiroom audio</a>, you don't need another receiver.</p><p>At around five inches tall and 17 inches wide, this isn't the slimmest receiver by a long shot, nor is it the lightest at around 15 pounds. That said, it shouldn't have trouble fitting in most entertainment centers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/yamaha-r-s202bl.png> <img data-field=badge-image src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpressstatic0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h5 class=display-card-title>Sony STR-DH190</h5><span>Best Stereo Receiver Overall</span><p class=display-card-description>The Sony STR-DH190 isn't perfect, but it's got all the features you'll need for listening to music on a great set of speakers, including Bluetooth and a phono input for plugging in your turntable.</p><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">See at Amazon</a><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">See at Bestbuy</a><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">See at Target</a><h2 id=best-budget-stereo-receiver-pyle-pt390btu-stereo-receiver>Best Budget Stereo Receiver: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Pyle PT390BTU Stereo Receiver</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pyle-pvta90-bluetooth-tube-amplifier.jpg><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Pros</p></th><th scope=col><p>Cons</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Bluetooth, plus USB and SD card slots</p></td><td><p>Only two RCA inputs</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Two RCA audio inputs and outputs</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>Front panel 3.5mm and microphone inputs</p></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>While you may need plenty of inputs in a home theater receiver, youâre not typically hooking too many devices to a stereo receiver, especially if you mainly use Bluetooth. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Pyle PT390BTU</a> has everything you need in a basic receiver, plus a handful of surprisingly useful features, all at a price that leaves you left with plenty to spend on speakers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The PT390BTU is a 300-Watt model with A and B speaker outputs, letting you run two pairs of speakers. When it comes to wired inputs, you get two sets of RCA inputs on the back. Neither of these is a phono output, so if youâre looking to connect a turntable, youâll need a third-party preamp unless the turntable has a built-in preamp. A pair of RCA outputs joins the inputs, letting you run a subwoofer or hook up a recorder.</p><p>The bulk of the PT390BTUâs connectivity has nothing to do with wires. Alongside the integrated AM/FM radio, you also get support for Bluetooth. This makes connecting a phone, tablet, or PC to play music over the receiver as easy as connecting to a set of headphones.</p><p>Everything so far has seemed fairly standard, but the PT390BTU still has a few tricks up its sleeve. The front of the receiver features a USB input and an SD card slot, both of which you can use to plug in a drive or a card of MP3 files to play directly through the receiver. The built-in remote makes skipping tracks much easier than using the front panel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking of the front panel, youâll also find a 3.5mm input, handy for plugging in an MP3 player or phone. Youâll also find a pair of 1/4-inch microphone jacks, which let you use the receiver as a karaoke machine if youâre in the mood. Thatâs not a feature youâll find on many other receivers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pyle-pvta90-thumb.png> <img data-field=badge-image src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpressstatic0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h5 class=display-card-title>Pyle PT390BTU Stereo Receiver</h5><span>Best Budget Stereo Receiver</span><p class=display-card-description>The Pyle PT390BTU stereo receiver has plenty of power but doesn't overload itself with inputs you probably won't need anyway.

The receiver features the usual SBC and AAC codecs, and while it would have been nice to see more advanced codecs, these don't often make it into stereo receivers.</p><p>Outside of Bluetooth, the R-S202BL focuses on keeping things simple and analog. You get four stereo RCA inputs, but none is a phono input. You also get a stereo output, which you can use for connecting a recording device or hooking up a powered subwoofer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The front panel is relatively simple, letting you switch between the various wired inputs and Bluetooth.

That said, one look at the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Pyle Bluetooth Tube Amplifier Stereo Receiver</a>, and youâll instantly soak up the vintage look. Itâs not just aesthetics either, as this receiver uses vacuum tubes, just like the classic receivers of yesteryear.</p><p>Many vacuum tube amps and receivers you see on the market still use class D amplifiers for the power section, only using tubes in the preamp section. This isnât the case with the Pyle, which uses vacuum tubes for both the preamp and power amp. There are digital elements of the receiver, but these have nothing to do with the sound, which remains pure analog.</p><p>This receiver features a pair of speaker outputs on the back, ready to deliver up to 1000 Watts of peak power. Back here, youâll also find a pair of RCA inputs, neither of which is phono-ready, and a subwoofer output. There is also a selector to switch between 120V and 240V power, depending on where youâre using the receiver.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The front panel holds the volume knob, an input selector, and transport controls. These let you navigate through songs when youâre connected via Bluetooth. The buttons also let you navigate through MP3s you can add via the USB port on the front.</p><p>While many vintage-style receivers only come in one color, the Pyle is available in either Black or Copper varieties. If you want to save on desk space, the company also makes a Mini version, though this is a hybrid, not a full tube model.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cambridge-axa35.png> <img data-field=badge-image src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpressstatic0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h5 class=display-card-title>Pyle PVTA90 Stereo Receiver</h5><span>Best Vintage Stereo Receiver</span>$206 <span class=regular-price>$250</span> Save $44<p class=display-card-description>The Pyle PVTA90 Stereo Receiver features a fully analog vacuum tube preamp and power amp, making for smooth, powerful sound.

The receiver also features a line out and a separate subwoofer out.</p><p>You can also connect to the TX-8220 via Bluetooth to play music from your other devices.

Even if you're only listening to one set, the massive EI transformer and other carefully chosen components lend a hefty weight to the sound.</p><p>The front panel of the TX-8220 is very clean, with four prominent pairs of buttons below the main strip to control bass, treble, balance, and the input you're playing back. Add the power button, volume control, and the 1/4-inch headphone jack, and you still have a nice-looking, uncluttered receiver.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <img data-field=badge-image src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpressstatic0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h5 class=display-card-title>Onkyo TX-8220</h5><span>Best Stereo Receiver for Vinyls</span><p class=display-card-description>With Bluetooth, a ton of both analog and digital wired connections, and a moving magnet phono stage, the Onkyo TX-8220 has all the connectivity you could possibly need, plus it sounds great.</p><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">See at Amazon</a><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">See at Crutchfield</a><h2 id=best-low-profile-stereo-receiver-cambridge-audio-axa35>Best Low Profile Stereo Receiver: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Cambridge Audio AXA35</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th><p>Pros</p></th><th><p>Cons</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Great looking low-profile design</p></td><td><p>No digital audio inputs</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Moving magnet phono stage</p></td><td><p>USB port doesn't allow flash drives</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Front panel auxiliary jack is great for portable players</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>USB port lets you connect a Bluetooth receiver</p></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Finding a receiver to fit a cramped space is always tricky, but it's especially tough if you're looking for something aesthetically pleasing that also sounds great. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Cambridge Audio AXA35</a> sees the well-known English brand expanding its offerings a bit, and it's perfect if you're looking for a low-profile model.</p><p>Of course, this is technically an integrated amplifier, not a receiver, as it has no built-in radio. It's also a little less powerful than some other receivers we're looking at, with just 35 Watts per channel, but that is more than enough for most music listening. You may have to increase the volume slightly more than you're used to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The AXA35 features four analog stereo RCA inputs, one of which is a moving magnet phono stage. You also get a 1/4-inch headphone jack and a 3.5mm auxiliary input on the front of the receiver. This is especially handy for plugging in an MP3 player.</p><p>You won't find Bluetooth on the AXA35, but it does offer options for digital audio. A USB port on the back doesn't function the way you'd expectâyou can't plug in a USB drive loaded with MP3s, for example. Instead, you can use this port to plug in a USB Bluetooth receiver.</p><p>The front panel is almost too barebones, as you'll need to dive into menus to adjust the balance or tone controls. That said, if you prefer a minimalist look, the AXA35 should be a nice fit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <img data-field=badge-image src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpressstatic0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h5 class=display-card-title>Cambridge Audio AXA35</h5><span>Best Low Profile Stereo Receiver</span><p class=display-card-description>While it's technically an integrated amplifier, the Cambridge Audio AXA35 will fit places other receivers won't.

Running a stereo RCA cable from your TV's red and white outputs to the same inputs on your stereo is the simplest way to connect.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3>How do I connect my amplifier to a stereo receiver?</h3><p>Plugging an amplifier into a stereo receiver could potentially damage it. If you're plugging in a preamp, this can go into an RCA line input. As a receiver is an amplifier, plugging another amplifier into it isn't necessary.</p><h3>Can I put something on top of my stereo receiver?</h3><p>You shouldn't place anything on top of your receiver, as this can cause the receiver to overheat and could damage it. The heat buildup could also damage whatever you place on top of the receiver.</p><h3>Do I need a stereo receiver for my home theater system?</h3><p>No. It's more likely that you need a <a href=# data-mce-href=https://www.howtogeek.com/775329/audio-channels-how-many-do-you-need-for-a-home-theater/>5.1-channel or higher receiver</a> for your home theater system.
