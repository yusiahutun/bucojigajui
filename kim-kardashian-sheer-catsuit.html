In a video shared to the shapewear brand's grid, she noted that the mesh one-piece was perfect for "some sexy time or a cute date night." And while Kim wore her bodysuit with nothing underneath, she advised others to layer over it with a coat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This completely snatches. I can't even begin to tell you. This is probably my favorite, favorite SKIMS piece. It's like a full snatch in a bodysuit," she said in the clip, as she posed from all angles while wearing the see-through garment. "You can totally wear it with a coat over, because you definitely don't want to wear it this sheer," Kardashian added, as she slung a Balenciaga faux fur jacket over her shoulders and put on a pair of black sunglasses and boots.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ever since she began seeing Pete Davidson, Kim's date night looks (and the dates themselves) have been decidedly more laid-back than usual. From movie theaters to pizza joints in Staten Island, Kim gushed about how the New York borough has been an "amazing place" for the couple to hang out during an appearance on Live! With Kelly and Ryan. "Staten Island is an amazing place," she said. "We had so much fun going to Staten Island. I wanted to check it out."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continued, "We take ferry rides everywhere. It's always been super low-key. That is the fun part of it. We can just chill and be low-key, ride around and see all the fun hometown stuff and sneak in and out of places."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8qipGajkaexor%2FHopinZaeawLV7yqKkZqORp7Giv8eimKdlo52ypr6MnJitq6WewQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
