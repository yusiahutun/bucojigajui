Debora and her partner tied the knot in 2012 in a private wedding ceremony.</p><p>Although Patta has kept her marriage under the radar, her husband is also reported to be a pro surfer and educator. Patta and Levy have been married for almost a decade without rumors of divorce or extra-marital relationship.</p><h2>Debora Patta Is Divorced Twice</h2><p>A popular news personality, Deborah had to face two terrible divorces with her marital life. Patta's first marriage happened to be in January 1996 with South-African filmmaker <strong>Mweli Mzizi.</strong> When Debora tied the knot with her then-husband Mweli, she faced a lot of racial abuse from South African society for marrying black skinned-man.</p><p>The marriage, however, lasted for hardly just six-year. In 2002, the couple decided to sign a divorce paper after irreconcilable differences with co-parenting one beautiful daughter named <strong>Chiara Mzizi </strong>who attended the University of Cape Town.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2021/05/07/a-picture-of-debora-patta-with-her-ex-husband-mweli-mzizi-at-her-wedding--1620395222.jpg width=450 height=356 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>A picture of Debora Patta with her ex-husband Mweli Mzizi at her wedding. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Pinterest</span></strong> &nbsp;<p><span class=imageSource>A year after divorcing Mzizi, Debora was able to find love again in life when she met businessman <strong>Lance Levitas</strong>.
