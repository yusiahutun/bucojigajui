Things took a dramatic turn when Tom’s whirlwind romance with Holmes ultimately led to their high-profile divorce in 2012.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After their separation, Suri and mum Holmes took a step back from the spotlight, prioritising their privacy and focusing on their personal lives. Over the years, Suri has become somewhat of a mystery, with her mother fiercely guarding her so she can have a normal upbringing and childhood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/02/64da3ee8-7953-451c-9019-50794dee9835_4c3bc3f2.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But despite Holmes’ best efforts, paparazzi still caught some glimpses of Suri as she roams the streets of New York City. And as she enters a new chapter of her life, she appears to be charting her own course and exploring the world on her own terms.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Here’s what Suri Cruise has been up to in 2023.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Who are the Kardashian-Jenners dating in 2023?

She remains in New York City with her mum and the two are more often spotted out and about together. Whether they are grabbing tacos, catching a Broadway play, or boarding a flight at the airport, the mother-daughter duo always turns heads with their effortless style and palpable closeness.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During the Covid-19 pandemic, they reportedly quarantined together at home and binge-watched one of Holmes’ iconic TV shows. In an interview with Variety, Holmes revealed that they watched plenty of shows together, including Dawson’s Creek (2008) – the hit show that launched Holmes’ career.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite her success, however, Holmes said that she never pressured her daughter to watch her work. “She has seen Dawson’s Creek, and I think it’s probably weird since she’s a teenager. I’m not like, ‘You need to watch mummy’s work.’ But during the pandemic, we had a good laugh about it. It’s wild to have a daughter who’s almost the same age as I was when I began all this,” she said in the Variety interview.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Her estranged relationship with dad Tom Cruise</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/02/60369a8c-c54e-4fe5-825a-4c56f6866441_23ae039d.jpg>A few months back, the media widely reported that Suri is not included in her dad’s holiday card any more. The news came about after <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">actress Brooke Shields</span></a>, who was once a recipient of the card and a gift of Christmas cake, shed more light on the evolution of Tom’s annual tradition in an interview with People magazine.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">7 of Keanu Reeves and Alexandra Grant’s cutest couple fashion moments</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Shields humorously recounted that the card originally included Tom, his ex-wife Holmes, and their daughter Suri. However, over time, the card went from including just Tom, to being sent sporadically. “It was from them and Suri [at first], so it was the three of them, and then soon it was no Suri and no Katie and just Tom,” Shields explained. “Then it went from just Tom for a while, but not every holiday. And then the cake stopped.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/02/8ac8239c-602c-4a6b-923c-39bece72aa71_e8f5e23c.jpg>Despite reports suggesting that <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Tom is not very involved in his daughter’s life</span></a>, divorce documents reveal that he agreed to pay his ex-wife Holmes US$400,000 annually in child support until their daughter Suri turns 18, per Hello! magazine. But the two have not been seen together in public for the last decade.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">She can also sing!</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Suri is following her mum’s footsteps in the entertainment industry and has wowed audiences with her impressive singing voice. Just last year, she was heard in Holmes’ film Alone Together, singing “Blue Moon” in the opening credits.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Holmes told Yahoo! Entertainment about her daughter’s role in the film, saying, “She’s very, very talented. She said she would do it and she recorded it and I let her do her thing. That’s the way I direct in general. It’s like, ‘This is what I think we all want so go do your thing.’”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When asked about why she chose her daughter for the job, Holmes replied, “I always want the highest level of talent, so I asked her.” High praise from mum indeed!</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Will she study fashion at university?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/02/e2ac36cf-0f71-41f6-ad4a-48413d4435ca_5c7c9312.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Hola magazine, Suri has been applying to several universities across NYC and many believed she would study fashion – her knack derived from mummy dearest, clearly.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">10 celebs who are estranged from their kids, from Tom Cruise to Elon Musk</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A source close to the family revealed to British media that Suri is applying to schools across the country, but her mother hopes she will stay in New York so they can be close to each other.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Holmes recently spoke to Glamour magazine about the importance of protecting her daughter from the public eye, commenting, “What has been really important for me with my daughter, because she was so visible at a young age, is I really like to protect her. I’m very grateful to be a parent, to be her parent. She’s an incredible person.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Her savvy fashion sense</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/02/7508284c-2288-49c6-9fc5-ffd67d53b172_3456d2ff.jpg>Suri has been a true fashionista since she was a baby.
