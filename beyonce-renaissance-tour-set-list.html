The song, which was featured on Beyoncé’s debut album&nbsp;Dangerously in Love, reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and led to other hits like “Check on It,” “Deja Vu” and “Me, Myself and I.” Since&nbsp;Dangerously in Love, Beyoncé has released six more albums: 2006’s&nbsp;B’Day, 2008’s&nbsp;I Am… Sasha Fierce, 2011’s&nbsp;4, 2013’s&nbsp;Beyoncé, 2016’s&nbsp;Lemonade&nbsp;and 2022’s&nbsp;Renaissance.</p><p data-skm-boomerang-el-3=processed>The album—also titled&nbsp;Act I: Renaissance—is the first act of a trilogy project <a href=# id=auto-tag_beyonce data-tag=beyonce>Beyonce</a>́ started during the COVID-19 pandemic. “Creating this album allowed me a place to dream and to find escape during a scary time for the world. It allowed me to feel free and adventurous in a time when little else was moving,” Beyoncé explained in an Instagram post on June 30, 2022. “My intention was to create a safe place, a place without judgment. A place to be free of perfectionism and overthinking. A place to scream, release, feel freedom. It was a beautiful journey of exploration. I hope you find joy in this music. I hope it inspires you to release the wiggle. Ha! And to feel as unique, strong, and sexy as you are.”</p><h2 data-skm-boomerang-el-3=processed>Beyoncé’s Renaissance World Tour Set List</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-1488935830.jpg><p>Beyoncé’s Renaissance tour setlist comprises 36 songs total—if there’s no divergence from the setlist that she performed to open the tour in Sweden on May 10, 2023.

She sang “Dangerously in Love,” a song she hasn’t performed live since 2009, and a ballad,” the writer wrote. “It was like she was her own opening act (there were no other opening acts, for the record)”. However, The New York Post reported in February 2023 that there were rumors singer and model Grace Jones would join her on tour. Jones has modeled for fashion brands like Yves St. Laurent and Kenzo, as well as magazines like Elle and Vogue. She’s also a new-wave singer best known for songs like “Private Life,” “Pull up to the Bumper,” “I’ve Seen That Face Before” and “Slave to the Rhythm.” Jones is also featured on Beyoncé’s song “Move” from her 2022 album, Renaissance.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ShoppingNewsletter_onsitegraphic.png alt="StyleCaster Shopping Newsletter Sign Up" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><i>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
