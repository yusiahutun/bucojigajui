It was only a matter of time before their hot-young-actorness collided in real life. She was the Dawson’s Creek good girl; he the American Pie heartthrob … Honestly, it would’ve been an early-aughts crime had these two not blessed the era’s red carpets with their coordinating denim and well-defined chins.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>J. Vespa/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After about four years together, Holmes and Klein revealed they were engaged in late 2003.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Why We Loved Them:</strong> As with most of Holmes’s relationships (excluding <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>that, uh, ONE</a>), she and Klein were very private. A month or two ahead of their engagement a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>People reporter attempted to snag some details</a> from Holmes regarding her and Klein’s living arrangements and she responded, “That’s our business. But thank you for wondering.” It’s always nice to be polite!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Years later, Klein remembered his and Holmes’s young love fondly. “I was working all the time and [Holmes] was involved in a TV show that filmed in Wilmington, North Carolina, so we’d hang on hiatuses,” he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Daily Beast</a> in 2012. “We were kids, man … We were all working, successful, and having fun. It was late ‘90s, young Hollywood, and we were having a good time ... not unlike all those vampires today.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We were like the prom king and queen,” Klein told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a>. “We had a similar upbringing and we were going through the same experience [in Hollywood].”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>SGranitz/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>When They Peaked:</strong> The year is 2000. You’re the star of a wildly successful teen drama. You’re wearing a muted rainbow dress on the red carpet of the MTV Movie Awards. Beside you, a teen idol; before you … BEYONCÉ .</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ke.Mazur/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">OK, this doesn’t actually have a lot to do with Klein, but we love this moment for Holmes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The Breakup:</strong> Holmes and Klein’s split was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>announced in March of 2005</a>. Of course, it was only about two months later that Holmes’s relationship with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Tom Cruise</a> made the media rounds. Just over one year following the news of Holmes and Klein’s split, the First Daughter star and Cruise were married and had welcomed daughter Suri.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Naturally, the timeline led many [gossip blogs] to believe Holmes had left Klein for Cruise. Klein himself cleared up the rumors, telling <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Access Hollywood</a>, “People are going to write what they want to write. Her being with Tom has nothing to do with her and I discontinuing our relationship.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Toward the beginning of the TomKat media frenzy, Holmes told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>W</a> that she and Klein “care about each other and we’re still friends,” strangely punctuating the statement with “Tom [Cruise] is the most incredible man in the world.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Klein gave more insight on the end of his and Holmes’s relationship years later, telling <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Daily Beast</a>, “Young Hollywood was ending. [Holmes’s] huge television show was ending. Life was changing and that adventure ended. It was a transitional period. So I was 25-years-old trying to find my voice, since my teenage one was played out.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ron Galella/Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“From my side there was a lot of denial and fear about the future,” Klein told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a> regarding the split. “It ended as amicably as these things can end.” He also mentioned that the breakup wasn’t publicized as soon as it happened. “We kept it to ourselves for a while,” he said. “It looked like it was Katie and Chris together and two seconds later Katie and Tom together, but that’s ridiculously compressed … Kate was incredibly respectful about the decision she was making to move on. She called and said, ‘Listen I want you to know before you see it anywhere else.’”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Where They Are Now:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Holmes and Cruise divorced in 2012. The following year she reportedly began dating Jamie Foxx. The ultra low-key couple quietly dated for years. They reportedly split in mid-2019.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress’s latest project, The Secret: Dare to Dream (based on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">Rhonda Byrne’s best-selling self-help book</a>) will be available to stream on PVOD platforms July 31.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Klein wed Laina Rose Thyfault in 2015.
