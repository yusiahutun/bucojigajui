Blanco is the founder of Pure Blanco, a firm that provides streetwear gear. He is well known for being the son of Griselda Blanco, the Cocaine Godmother and Drug Lord. In addition, he is known as â€˜The Last Blanco.â€™</h3><h2>What is the Net Worth of Michael Blanco?</h2><p>Blancoâ€™s net worth is expected to be <strong>$5 million</strong> in 2022. This includes his property, funds, and earnings. His principal source of income is his entrepreneurial endeavors. His annual salary or earnings, however, are not publicly available.</p><h2>Early Life, and Family of Michael Blanco</h2><p>Blanco will be 44 years old in 2022. Michael Corleone Blanco was born in Medelln, Colombia, on August 5, 1978. Leo is his zodiac sign. He is a member of the Caucasian ethnic group.</p><p>Dario Sepulveda, Blancoâ€™s father, and Griselda Blanco, Blancoâ€™s mother, are Blancoâ€™s parents. His mother, Griselda, worked as a Cocaine saleswoman. Michael used to run from one corner to the next as a kid, trying to remain one step ahead of his motherâ€™s adversaries and drug dealers.</p><h2>Is Griselda, his mother, a criminal?</h2><p>Griselda murdered her three husbands. Michaelâ€™s father, Dario, was assassinated by Michaelâ€™s mother because he was attempting to acquire full custody of Michael. In the early 1970s, Griselda Blanco became involved in the cocaine trade. La Madrina, the Black Widow, and the Queen of Narco-Trafficking are some of her pet names. She went on to become the first female billionaire criminal and the deadliest woman in history.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Griselda_Blanco_Medellin.jpg><p>Griselda assisted her boss in kidnapping a youngster at the age of 11 and promptly executed him after his wealthy family refused to pay the ransom. She was a pickpocket and a prostitute, to boot. Michaelâ€™s mother led a multimillion-dollar drug trafficking operation with aplomb. Finally, on September 3, 2012, Griselda died in Medelln, Colombia. A biker shot her twice, once in the head and once in the shoulder, to kill her.</p><p>Blanco also bribed correctional authorities and directed her motherâ€™s followers through their to-do list. She was openly bisexual and murdered her three marriages.</p><h2>Professional Career</h2><p>He worked as his motherâ€™s aide in some capacity since he was a child. Later in life, as he grew older, he desired to convey a clean image of his motherâ€™s hard profession, which prompted him to start his own business.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel="noopener nofollow">A post shared by Michael Corleone Blanco ðŸ•· (@michaelcorleoneblanco)</a></p><p>He was the CEO of Pure Blanco, a streetwear fashion company.
