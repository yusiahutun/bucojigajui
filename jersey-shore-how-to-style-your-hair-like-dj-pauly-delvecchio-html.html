It’s always been spiked up in some way or form.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-3_70>DelVecchio’s blowout quickly became his signature look as a roommate on&nbsp;Jersey Shore.

I blow-dry it and I use a pick and I pick it up, almost like an Afro — my hair’s really thick. And then I put in the product. [Mine is] like Elmer’s Glue.” DelVecchio uses Spiker brand, according to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="New York Daily News (opens in a new tab)">New York Daily News</a>. “If you’re not using Spiker, you don’t have a blowout,” he claims.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_51>Then, DelVecchio follows these steps: “I put it all through my hair, spray it, blow-dry it again, and then I use the pick to get those spikes perfect.” To this day, DelVecchio uses the same products to style his hair. “I don’t change,” he said. “I’m like a creature of habit.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS3pr7SnrBmq5ikv6Z5x6iuZqyfYsC1xcueZLKnpad6qa3Iq2SloZuaeqW2jKmYrqSpYrGmuNWempygmaR7qcDMpWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
