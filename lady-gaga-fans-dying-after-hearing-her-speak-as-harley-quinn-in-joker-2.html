It’s the first time fans have heard her voice in the anticipated sequel to the 2019 film.</strong></p><p><a href=#>Lady Gaga</a> has made her official debut as Harley Quinn for Joker 2 – full title Joker: Folie a Deux in a new soundbite. Fellow <a href=#>movie</a> star Joaquin Phoenix will return as the eerie Joker alongside Gaga, real name Stefani Germanotta. As film fans eagerly wait five days for the first trailer to drop, the official <a href=#>TikTok</a> account for the movie released a clip of Lady Gaga speaking as Harley Quinn – which fans say they’re obsessed with despite having to wait until October to see Joker 2 in the theaters.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lady-gaga-s-official-debut-as-harley-quinn-in-joker-2>Lady Gaga’s official debut as Harley Quinn in Joker 2</h2><p>The DC Studios flick will see Lady Gaga switch up the accent for Harley Quinn, which is a new direction compared to other <a href=#>celebrities</a> who have taken on the role.</p><p>Most actresses who play Quinn tend to go for a Brooklyn accent, because the original voice actor, Arleen Sorkin, had one for the 1992 edition, Batman: The Animated Series.</p><p><a href=#>Margot Robbie</a> also played into this for her part in Suicide Squad, Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey and The Suicide Squad. The <a href=#>Barbie</a> star has no doubts Gaga will ‘crush it’, as she said earlier this year.</p><p>The 2019 movie follows aspiring comic and clown performer Arthur Fleck, who is cruelly bullied and treated in all social circles. His alternative ego, a violent Joker, emerges after the years of being romantically and socially rejected. Joker then goes on to be seen as a cult hero in troubling times within the city.</p><p>Phoenix took home an <a href=#>Oscar</a> for his performance, with the film taking in more than $1 billion at the Box Office. It also became <a href=#>Hollywood</a>‘s most profitable R-rated movie ever.</p><p>Fans have been teased over Lady Gaga’s role in Joker 2 ever since it was announced she would play Harley Quinn. First there was an animated clip of Quinn and Joker dancing, before a photo of the two looking into each other’s eyes was released for Valentine’s Day.</p><p>The movie’s title, Folie a Deux, translates to a medical term to refer to an identical or similar mental disorder that affects two or more people.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-small-leaks-have-ignited-fans-anticipations-for-the-movie>Small leaks have ignited fans’ anticipations for the movie</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Fans have seen Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn though before, when Joker 2 was being filmed in the Bronx, New York, last year. The <a href=#>music</a> star was spotted dancing while walking up the steps, to the song Rock and Roll Part 2 by Gary Glitter.</p><p>It’s not been confirmed if this is seen was being filmed for the final cut, or it was just a way to entertain fans who had gathered.</p><p>But since the release of the audio, they’re definitely excited, to say the least.</p><p>One fan wrote: “Gaga’s voice, I’m dying.”</p><p>A second added: “We are not ready for this movie.”</p><p>While a third penned: “I’m so excited, can’t wait,” and a fourth echoed: “I have a feeling that Gaga is going to devour this role”.</p><p><strong>Joker: Folie a Deux is expected to release in theaters on October 4, 2024. It’ll be five years to the day since the original movie came out.</strong></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2WAcLjAnbBmn5Gcrm6ywKeqZpypnruoecCfq56qXZ2yor7Ip55moJWnerS8xJqiZpmjYrWivsuesGappZ67r3nIp2Sjp5uav25%2Bjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
