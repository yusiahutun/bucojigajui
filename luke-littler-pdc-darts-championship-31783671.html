The 16-year-old continued his remarkable run in the Paddy Power PDC World Darts Championship after quickly dismissing Dolan 4-1 in Monday's (January 1) afternoon clash. A semi-final match-up against world No8 Rob Cross awaits the teenager on Tuesday (January 2).
With his performance against the Northern Ireland legend once again being top-notch, Littler was certainly comfortable enough to have fun with the ever-rowdy Ally Pally crowd during the first set of the match."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

However, before throwing the third dart, the confident teen turned around and looked at the sea of fans who egged him on to throw the bullseye.</p><p>Unfortunately, he narrowly missed but managed to secure the first set in his next throw. At just 16 years of age, he continues to make history every time he steps on the stage and the fans look to be enjoying it with one X (formerly known as Twitter) calling him: "absolute class".</p><p><b><i>Is Luke Littler the next superstar of darts?
