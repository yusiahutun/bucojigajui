"[They said] I wouldn't be replacing Chris. Then all these articles started coming out, saying, 'Tayshia Adams and Kaitlyn Bristowe replacing Chris Harrison.'

I just want him to know that I thought he was irreplaceable and I didn't want to step on toes."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:d87b12b3-0e3c-4298-9f10-8cbd6cc87b8a data-container-ref=toofab:article:878fb942-9dfb-463a-b7c4-bf795cbb110d data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ab/5by4/2023/01/10/ab3fc96f18544050bdc8cf6eb9c551ff_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Chris Harrison Breaks Silence on Bachelor Exit Amid Racism Controversy: 'I Was Heartbroken'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Though the "Dancing With The Stars" alum "didn’t know" the extent of her role at the time, Kaitlyn said tabloid articles and rumors she would be replacing the longstanding host made her "feel icky" about her new gig. His lack of response also left her thinking, "Okay, he hates me.

Kirkconnell eventually became the winner of <a href=#>Matt James</a>' season -- the first-ever Black "Bachelor" lead.</p><p>Instead of condemning her attendance while chatting with the first-ever Black "Bachelorette" lead, <a href=#>Rachel Lindsay</a>, on "Extra," Harrison said, "Well, Rachel, is it a good look in 2018, or is it not a good look in 2021? Because there's a big difference."</p><p>To this, Lindsay responded, "It's not a good look, ever." His defense led to him permanently stepping down from the role, with former "Bachelor" Jesse Palmer eventually becoming the new permanent host.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:82b21e2a-49d4-4584-8f9c-38c11c62026c data-container-ref=toofab:article:878fb942-9dfb-463a-b7c4-bf795cbb110d data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/38/5by4/2022/12/02/38cce70835cb49c59e4cf560c0db9457_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">11 Celebs Who Dated Bachelor Nation Stars</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Bristowe said she reached out to both Rachel and Chris following the interview.</p><p>"When this all went down, I reached out to Rachel and I reached out to Chris and I said, 'What you did was wrong and you know that. I understand there's so much more to it but what do you want me to do to support you while also standing up for what I believe in,'" she explained. "Then he called and we talked and he said he didn't want anyone to really get involved. [He said,] 'It's hard and I understand that you have to like, say what you need to say.'"</p><p>The snag in their relationship caused her to "[bawl] my eyes out," saying their bond "just felt like it went down the toilet."</p><p>While the status of their friendship may be upsetting, Kaitlyn said she's trying not to take it personally. "I don't think it was actually about me if I can remove my ego. I think he was going through so much in his life. He lost 20 lbs. He was depressed," she admitted, noting that Harrison was "probably really crushed" about his exit after wanting to leave his 20 year gig "out on top."</p><p><a href=#>Harrison himself just opened up about his exit for the first time on a podcast of his own -- see what he had to say about everything here.</a></p><a id=gallery-link-f71c6872-1c96-58b2-8717-9e133a469283 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:f71c6872-1c96-58b2-8717-9e133a469283 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:878fb942-9dfb-463a-b7c4-bf795cbb110d data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/8c/4by3/2020/03/09/8c0a0782a94f589d81d731b44d5a4407_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2tmaWlfoK6qwMuypWaaop7AtbvWnmScoKKewG60wKupoqufo3qjrcKhnKWnoprBtbGO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
