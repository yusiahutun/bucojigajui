Cosmetic Dermatology in many ways was made for me. My mother, who was a nurse, pushed for dermatology as well. She felt that people ignore physical complaints to avoid the regular doctor, but always run to the dermatologist if something showed up on their skin they could see. Plus, she never saw dermatologists in the hospital. When she did, they were the most rested and best dressed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>How did you come up with the concept for your practice?</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I knew from the beginning that I wanted to be in practice for myself, and that is exactly what I did immediately after training in 2000. Cosmetic dermatology was still in its infancy. People thought I was crazy to go at it alone and focus solely on this subspecialty. Even today most practices are a mix of general surgical and cosmetic dermatology, not just cosmetic. I was focused. It was my passion, and I am still constantly adapting and changing to drive growth and advancements. If you want something done medically, then go somewhere where that is ALL they practice.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>How have you changed the landscape when it comes to dermatology and cosmetic surgery?</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I believe that I have really helped changed the way people think about cosmetic enhancements. The stigma of “risky procedures” and “excessive vanity” have been around for too long. That is not what my practice or the future of rejuvenation is about. It is not about being young or beautiful per se, or changing who we are. It’s about doing things that maximize what was given to us. Maintaining youthful attributes as we also try and do with our muscles, hair and nails, and our nutrition. What I do for many patients is a form of grooming. Small, frequent efforts make big differences, and it is about maintenance, like nutrition and exercise. The art is finding the combination of things and performing them in a way that is approachable, manageable, and effortless looking. Without modern medicine most of our bodies wouldn’t have survived this long anyway. So why shouldn’t we use the tools and art of modern medicine to maintain the wellness, health, and beauty of our skin?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Trust Us, We Tried It: Microfeathering and Botox</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>How do you take care of your skin?</b> My skincare routine has become simpler and simpler. Less is more for me at home topically. I really rely on sleep, exercise, nutrition, and meditation to keep all of my body looking and feeling well, but I certainly harness the minimally invasive tools that I use in my office to keep me looking my best.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>What would you recommend as the single most effective cosmetic treatment investment for glowing skin?</b> The Fraxel Dual laser. No one above the age of 25 can’t benefit from some degree of this treatment. It is safe, versatile, and when used in experienced hands, extremely effective. It removes sun damage, builds and remodels collagen, decreases the risk of common skin cancer, and it makes you look great. It is the most valuable tool in my practice of 30 lasers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>What’s one mistake most women make when it comes to skincare that they could easily fix?</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They can have the tendency to complicate or change regimens too often looking for next best thing. Skincare and cosmetic treatments require consistency. New is not always better.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZK%2BmrdStsGaan6jAbrDOnKuoql2bv6K6yg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
