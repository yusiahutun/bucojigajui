In a candid interview with Vogue, VB said: "We both realise that we are stronger together than we are as individuals. Would either of us be in the position that we are in now had we not met and been together all those years ago? It’s all about the family unit."</p><p id=eQo62b6UaLc data-wc=19>In honour of Victoria's 50th birthday, we've rounded up some of her most romantic, loved-up photos with her husband…</p><p id=eM_QcyrYUfE></p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">DON'T MISS:</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Bronzed Victoria Beckham could be a noughties bride in corseted mini dress" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/ba6fbb6eb7ae-victoria-beckham-bob.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Bronzed Victoria Beckham could be a noughties bride in corseted mini dress" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Bronzed Victoria Beckham could be a noughties bride in corseted mini dress</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Long-lasting celebrity couples: Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas, Rita Wilson and Tom Hanks & more" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/fb7f6957d13b-celeb-couples.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Long-lasting celebrity couples: Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas, Rita Wilson and Tom Hanks & more" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Long-lasting celebrity couples: Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas, Rita Wilson and Tom Hanks & more</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Showstopping celeb wedding guest shoes: From Princess Beatrice's trainers to Victoria Beckham's skyscraper heels" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/a963a9d5a25f-untitled-1.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Showstopping celeb wedding guest shoes: From Princess Beatrice's trainers to Victoria Beckham's skyscraper heels" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Showstopping celeb wedding guest shoes: From Princess Beatrice's trainers to Victoria Beckham's skyscraper heels</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Nicole Kidman's unconventional marriage rule with Keith Urban he's tried to break" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/c3000215bf0a-gettyimages-1252511316.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Nicole Kidman's unconventional marriage rule with Keith Urban he's tried to break" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Nicole Kidman's unconventional marriage rule with Keith Urban he's tried to break</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Kelly Ripa just rocked figure-skimming wedding guest dress and cascading curls" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/c37ef18131db-gettyimages-1473066120.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Kelly Ripa just rocked figure-skimming wedding guest dress and cascading curls" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Kelly Ripa just rocked figure-skimming wedding guest dress and cascading curls</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/ec21b58e9520-gettyimages-2517841.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=ec21b58e9520-gettyimages-2517841>The engagement</h2><p dir=ltr>Love was in the air at the couple's engagement photoshoot in January 1998, which allowed Victoria to debut her three-carat marquise-cut diamond ring, estimated to cost £65,000. Donning matching black outfits, the couple were not shy about sharing a hug or kiss in front of the cameras.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/8432dcfa35b8-beckhams-awards-dinner.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=8432dcfa35b8-beckhams-awards-dinner>Private moment</h2><p dir=ltr>It's not clear whether David was whispering a secret in Victoria's ear or kissing her on the cheek, but one thing's for certain, the couple were enjoying a private moment at the 1999 MOBO Awards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4b422e7856ca-victoria-david-wedding-venue.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=4b422e7856ca-victoria-david-wedding-venue>Fairytale wedding</h2><p dir=ltr>As they <a href=#>exchanged vows at Luttrellstown Castle</a> in Dublin in July 1999, the pair were pictured sharing stolen glances, holding hands and posing for loved-up photos with their young son and page boy Brooklyn.

David was spotted putting his arms around his new wife as she giggled at the affectionate gesture.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9cb0fc96be76-david-kissing-victoria-nose.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=9cb0fc96be76-david-kissing-victoria-nose>Moment of celebration</h2><p dir=ltr>Victoria was by England football captain David's side to celebrate when he was awarded an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2003. The athlete tenderly placed a kiss on the singer's nose as she made a pout back at him.</p><p dir=ltr>"I am honoured and privileged to receive this recognition. It's not just for me but for Manchester United, England, all of my teammates and my family," he said at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b12979a89665-victoria-beckham-hugging-david.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=b12979a89665-victoria-beckham-hugging-david>Lost in the moment</h2><p dir=ltr>Victoria had her eyes tightly shut as she enjoyed a sweet hug with David while supporting him at The David Beckham Academy launch party in 2005 – the same year they purchased a home in Spain after David signed for Real Madrid.</p><p dir=ltr>While the pair opened up about their difficult time relocating, this unearthed photo shows they didn't let it permanently come between them. "If I'm being honest it's probably the most unhappy I have ever been in my entire life," she recalled in the Netflix documentary, Beckham.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/30a51fe7e264-gettyimages-1078179128.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=30a51fe7e264-gettyimages-1078179128>Dinner date</h2><p dir=ltr>Fast forward to 2019 and the parents-of-four enjoyed a dinner date at London Fashion Week.

The couple were too engrossed in taking a kissing selfie in a photo David shared on Valentine's Day, captioned: "Happy Valentine's to an amazing wife, mummy and best friend. I love you. I mean, 'I just fancied her.'"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f7698551744d-4183812807985018920060498134745923520706932n.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=f7698551744d-4183812807985018920060498134745923520706932n>Locking lips</h2><p dir=ltr>To mark Juergen Teller's exhibition at Le Grand Palais in January 2024, VB posted a series of photos on Instagram – including a very close-up shot of her locking lips with her husband. With her short pixie cut and David's long blonde locks, the picture appears to have been taken early in their relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c1d406333c49-4310955124259759565554017893110299854051712n.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=c1d406333c49-4310955124259759565554017893110299854051712n>Sweeping her off her feet</h2><p dir=ltr>After sustaining a broken foot at the gym in February 2024, Victoria has been struggling to walk and has had to resort to using a scooter for better mobility. But David didn't let that stop her from attending her fashion label's autumn/winter 2024 collection launch, taking the weight off her feet as he lifted her into a cute piggyback. "Always supporting me (literally) I love you so much @davidbeckham x Kisses x #VBAW24," she wrote.</p><p id=eBt4xGoOd81 data-wc=14><strong>PHOTOS: <a class=hm-link href=#>Red carpet wedding dresses!
