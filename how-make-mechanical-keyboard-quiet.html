Unfortunately, there is simply no such thing as a noiseless keyboard, and the degree to which a keyboard is noisy depends on how clicky its keys are.</p><p>There are some ways you can try to quiet your noisy mechanical keyboard if it is constantly annoying your siblings while playing games or making a racket in the office. Clearly, they won't make your keyboard whisper-quiet, but they will significantly reduce its noise.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Without further ado, let's explore why mechanical keyboards are so loud and how you can reduce the noise.</p><h2 id=why-mechanical-keyboards-are-loud>Why Mechanical Keyboards Are Loud?</h2><p>The key reason behind noisy mechanical keyboards is the very mechanism by which they work. A slider under the keycap transfers the force you exert on a keyboard key down to the spring, in turn activating the electrical circuit. The transfer of force produces noise, but that is how keyboard input is fed to your system.</p><p>After years of use, the slider underneath your keys can become rough and add frictional noise, or you might have bought a mechanical keyboard with loud, clicky switches to begin with. Either way, noise is noise.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Now that you know why mechanical keyboards are louder, let's explore some quick DIY ways to silence them.</p><h2 id=change-your-work-surface>1. Change Your Work Surface</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Rough-Table-Surface.jpg><p>The surface you use for your keyboard plays a vital role in either reducing or amplifying the noise. When used on an old desk full of dents, your mechanical keyboard is likely to be noisier. Place it on a smooth surface and see if that makes a difference.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Ergonomic Keyboards Can Boost Your Health and Productivity</a></span></p><p>Your keyboard's placement also contributes to the noise made by your clicks. Usually, the force transferred to your keyboard spring is dampened somewhere beneath the support. When it's half on the table and a half away from it, there's nothing to explain why it sounds louder. It's the same reason why your keyboard is noisier when you use it on a lap.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Therefore, you should first check its placement and change your working surface if possible. <a href=#>Buying a desk pad</a> may be a better option if you cannot afford a new one.</p><h2 id=using-a-desk-mat>2. Using a Desk Mat</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Keyboard-and-Mouse-Placed-on-a-Pad-on-Working-Table.jpg><p>Perhaps you have a mouse pad nearby. Place your keyboard on the pad and start typing and see if the pad muffles your keyboard noise. If so, consider purchasing a desk mat.</p><p>Typing on your keyboard causes some force to be transferred to the working surface. This vibration in a surface tends to up the vibrational noise, which amplifies the noise level. Therefore, it is imperative to dampen off that force before it reaches the desk. Using a desk mat can help you do this, acting as a damper.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Satechi Eco-Leather Deskmate</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Felt Desk Mat </a>are two popular desk mats options that you can buy today.</p><p>If changing the placement, shifting to a smooth surface, and dampening the vibrational noise with a desk mat hasn't silenced your keyboard, you'll need to open it up and make some mechanical adjustments.</p><h2 id=using-o-rings-as-dampers>3. Using O-Rings as Dampers</h2><p>Generally, O-rings are used around the edge of the drumhead to reduce overtones. In keyboards, they dampen out noise caused by key presses.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Install the O-rings on the switches after removing the keycaps from your keys one by one. It will now dampen out some noise with each keystroke, making your keyboard a bit less noisy.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Best Budget-Friendly Gaming Keyboards</a></span></p><p>If you do this, your keys may become more sloppy, taking away the very purpose for which you've spent so much money on a clicky mechanical keyboard. Aside from that, they tend to wear out over time due to frequent keystrokes. Therefore, they need to be replaced frequently.</p><p>So, if this is something you can live with, then go ahead and install O-rings. If not, try some of the other fixes listed on the list.</p><h2 id=add-foam-inside-keyboard>4. Add Foam Inside Keyboard</h2><p>Foam can help reduce the internal vibrational noise of your keyboard. It is a relatively cheap and easy way to reduce overall keyboard noise. The only downside is its high time consumption; otherwise, it's as easy as pulling out the plastic clips or unscrewing your keyboard, then placing the foam right between the bottom and PCB.</p><p>Sobrathane and Neoprene are two popular foam options. Sobrathane will likely reduce noise to a great extent, but it may make your keyboard heavier. On the other hand, neoprene is relatively lightweight and inexpensive, but it does not reduce noise as much as Sobrathane.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>You can also use the same packing foam your keyboard came in if you have a tight budget. If you have already sent it to your local dump, pick up some shelf liner near you and use it instead. Even though these two options are almost free, they won't significantly reduce keyboard noise.</p><h2 id=add-lubrication-to-keyboard-switches>5. Add Lubrication to Keyboard Switches</h2><p>You can also use this time-consuming yet effective method to calm down your noisy keyboard. Lubrication help reduce frictional noise between the spring and stem of each switch.</p><p>As you'll have to desolder the switches while removing them, the process of adding lube and reinstalling the switches will also take a lot of time, so it's not an ideal fix for most users. But if you have the time, it can be worthwhile.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Optical vs. Mechanical Switches: What's Best for Gaming?</a></span></p><p>Moreover, be careful not to add too much lube, or it will start acting as resistance. If you do this, you may end up making some of your keys dysfunctional. Finally, when using lube, ensure it's safe for plastic. <strong>You should only attempt this fix if you know what you are doing</strong>.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=replace-keyboard-or-build-a-customized-one>6. Replace Keyboard or Build a Customized One</h2><p>If you haven't reduced noise yet after following all the above steps, your noisy keyboard won't calm down any time soon. If that is the case, replace it with a less noisy keyboard with linear switches rather than a clicky one. And, if you're too crazy about your gaming experience, you can build your custom keyboard.</p><p>When you can pick your own case, keys, and switches and configure them in the way you wish, you may end up building a super quiet board.</p><h2 id=calm-down-your-noisy-keyboard>Calm Down Your Noisy Keyboard</h2><p>Hopefully, these fixes will help you to quiet your noisy keyboard. But, if you are not a skilled DIYer, stay away from more technical options. And, whenever something goes wrong, you will always have the option of getting it checked by a technician.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGifqK9doq6ssYymnJygkaO2pK3LZqKesZKkrrOwjKqsop2kZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
