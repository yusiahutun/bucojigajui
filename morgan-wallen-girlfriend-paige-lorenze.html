&#34;I love you! And am so proud of you,&#34; Lorenze writes.
Though the photo was the first time Lorenze and Wallen have appeared together as a couple on social media, it's likely that their relationship isn't brand new: According to an early February report from Page Six, they've been together for &#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The run, which is expected to continue through September, is part of the singer's return to the spotlight following the release of video footage in February 2021 that showed him yelling a racist slur. In the wake of that incident, Wallen — who had just put out his Dangerous: The Double Album and was on an arc towards country superstardom — withdrew from the country mainstream, and was benched by many facets of the industry.</p><p>The singer reflected on the incident in a mid-2021 Good Morning America interview, where he pledged to donate $500,000 to Black-led organizations (a pledge he fulfilled by early 2022).</p><p>Wallen's also had an eventual past few years in the romance department. In July 2020, he and ex-girlfriend&nbsp;Katie Smith welcomed a son, Indigo Wilder.</p><p>For her part, Lorenze has also had a highly public love life in the past. She previously dated actor Armie Hammer and was one of multiple women who have made allegations <a href=#>regarding his "scary" behavior</a>. Per People, Lorenze says that she felt unsafe with Hammer, and that she ended their relationship once he started "making rules for me of things I could and couldn't do."</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>See Inside Morgan Wallen's Recently Sold Nashville Home</h2><a href=#>Morgan Wallen</a> has sold his Nashville home for $835,000.
