The Post (2017)</h3>“I just thought this was the right time to talk about freedom of the press, to talk about the right of free speech, [and] celebrate the hard work of journalism and news reporting,” said director Steven Spielberg when he made <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">The Post</span></a> – a perfect film for a double bill with All the President’s Men.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The story lays the groundwork for the Watergate scandal, in which the administration of US president Richard Nixon attempted to cover up its break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington as part of a political spying and sabotage campaign.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The film is less about dogged detective work and more about fighting for the right to publish – in this case, the potentially damaging Pentagon Papers, classified documents concerning America’s deception over its involvement in Vietnam. The need to scoop your rivals has never felt so urgent.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">9. Salvador (1986)</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s not always the written word that compels. Salvador – still one of Oliver Stone’s best movies – tells of photojournalist Richard Boyle and his coverage of the civil war in El Salvador.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">James Woods has never been better than he is here as Boyle, a man devoted to his work but hampered by substance abuse problems.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Stone, who co-wrote the script with Boyle, revels in the sleaziness of his protagonist, but also emphasises his principles – as he discovers just how the US government is supporting El Salvador’s right-wing military dictatorship.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">8. Broadcast News (1987)</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The world of TV news was beautifully realised by James L. Brooks in this appealing romcom that took audiences behind the scenes of the Washington bureau of a national news network.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Albert Brooks, Holly Hunter and William Hurt take the leads, with the latter excelling as the charming, good-looking, but vapid anchorman who has come to represent everything Brooks’ character hates about the media.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">The 12 best Asian films of 2021: Drive My Car, Drifting, The Falls and more</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Critic Roger Ebert called it as “knowledgeable about the TV newsgathering process as any movie ever made” – a comment that could still stand today.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">7. Shattered Glass (2003)</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Most films about journalism are heroic tales of reporters unearthing institutional corruption; Billy Ray’s true-life drama is quite the opposite.</p>Hayden Christensen – who was then in the midst of playing Darth Vader in the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Star Wars</span></a> prequels – excels as Stephen Glass, a writer for political commentary magazine The New Republic, who is gradually revealed to have fabricated or falsified a huge number of his stories.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Flanked by a tremendous supporting cast, including Peter Sarsgaard, who plays editor Charles Lane, Christensen embodies a low-key likeability.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This, the audience comes to realise, is just why he managed to get away with such grand deceptions in the first place.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/15/08ed240f-12a5-40e9-92c6-29b888390214_bbde77da.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">6. His Girl Friday (1940)</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Howard Hawks’ screwball comedy, based on the influential Broadway play The Front Page, has come to embody the screen image of the old-school newspaper reporter: fast-talking and cynical as hell.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Rosalind Russell is glorious as The Morning Sun star reporter Hildy Johnson (aped entirely by Jennifer Jason Leigh in the Coen Brothers’ 1994 movie The Hudsucker Proxy).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Set to marry – much to the chagrin of her editor/ex-lover (Cary Grant) – she ends up covering a death row case.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If any film shows how reporters will follow their story to the detriment of everything else including their personal life, it’s this.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">5. Network (1976)</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Prefiguring the avalanche of angry opinion formers that would swamp US prime time in the 1980s, Peter Finch’s Howard Beale, “the mad prophet of the airwaves”, remains an iconic creation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Critically, he arrived just two years after the first ever on-screen suicide, as Florida reporter Christine Chubbuck took her own life in 1974 – an event dramatised in 2016’s Christine, with Rebecca Hall.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/15/9aff819b-2030-4b8e-9a65-d8df74e3d7be_3da93ff1.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">4. Fletch (1985)</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Gregory Mcdonald’s series of books about an investigative reporter for the Los Angeles Times provided former Saturday Night Live comedian Chevy Chase with one of his most endearing roles.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Directed by Michael Ritchie, Chase’s Irwin M. Fletcher truly captures the spirit of poking your nose in where it’s really not wanted.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While Fletch’s disguises and false names lent a lightheartedness to the film, the noirish plot about police corruption and narcotics trafficking lends just the right amount of intrigue.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Serenaded by Harold Faltermeyer’s score, it’s also a fine look at how the best hacks don’t take no for an answer, even from their bosses.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">3. Ace in the Hole (1951)</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Director Billy Wilder was fascinated by journalists. His 1974 comedy The Front Page cast Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon in a remake of the play that had already inspired His Girl Friday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But 15 years before that, he made this stone-cold classic, starring Kirk Douglas as Chuck Tatum, an on-the-slide reporter who gets a job at the Albuquerque Sun-Bulletin.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When he discovers a man trapped in a cave, he cynically exploits the situation to reboot his career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/15/3dda3fd5-6253-4efa-8498-22327a279e9f_fcdaf32a.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The film flopped on release, Wilder believing audiences “did not believe me that when somebody’s a newspaperman, they are capable of that behaviour”. How wrong they were.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">2. Spotlight (2015)</h3>A worthy Oscar best picture winner, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Spotlight</span></a> shows how the Boston Globe’s investigative unit, Spotlight, picked at a scab on the Catholic Church and uncovered a festering wound.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Director Tom McCarthy, who had already played a reporter in TV sensation The Wire, brought huge credibility to this tale of paedophile priests and how their crimes were covered up by church officials.</p>With a cast led by Mark Ruffalo as journalist Michael Rezendes, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">this film</span></a> really impresses in how McCarthy conveys the old-school legwork of journalism, combing through endless filing cabinets in search of that one crucial clue to crack the story.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">1. All the President’s Men (1976)</h3>The grandaddy of all journalism films, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Alan J. Pakula’s masterpiece</span></a> tells of how Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein uncovered the Watergate scandal, which ultimately led to the resignation as US president of Richard Nixon.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Casting Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman, both in the prime of their careers, was a coup, but this is not a film that skates by on the performances of its A-list stars.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Oscar-winning script by William Goldman offers a dense, methodical account of how the story broke, right down to meeting the vital informant known only as “Deep Throat” in an underground car park.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/15/9b85eaa5-50cc-49c9-9306-bd18d72f23f3_0bdfabea.jpg>Want more articles like this?
