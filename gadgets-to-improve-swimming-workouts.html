But you might not know that there are tech gadgets out there that can take your workouts to the next level, regardless of your swimming skills. So, let's dive in, shall we?</p><h2 id=performance-monitors>1. Performance Monitors</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-19-at-3-43-40-pm.jpg><p>There are many benefits to monitoring and tracking your performance in the pool, and that's why there's no shortage of waterproof fitness trackers from smaller dedicated companies like FINIS and Triton to major players like Garmin and Apple.</p><p>Performance monitors can not only help you set goals but also track data in real-time so that you can analyze your performance. This helps you reach your goals, compare yourself against others, and receive guidance to improve your speed, form, and fitness level.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For example, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Triton 2</a> from TritonWear, used by professional swimmers, is a device you're supposed to wear under your swim cap, while the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">INCUS</a> is designed to be worn on your back. Data captured by these devices can provide insights into everything, including distance traveled, stroke distribution, and form.</p><p>Of course, you can use the Apple Watch Series 2 or later to track your swim metrics. While it might be less hydrodynamic than the Triton 2 or INUCS, you can set goals, including calories burned, distance, or time, and measure the number of laps you complete in a pool. The <a href=#>benefit of using an Apple Watch</a> is that you get all the other features associated with a smartwatch.</p><h2 id=smart-swim-goggles>2. Smart Swim Goggles</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-18-at-8-25-56-am-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gone are the days of simple swim goggles that prevent chlorinated water from touching your eyeballs. We now live in the age of augmented reality, and swim goggles have evolved to feature a heads-up display that can project stats in your field of view while you maintain your ability to see. Activities that can be displayed include swim analytics, distance, speed, lap count, heart rate, and more.</p><p>For example, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FORM Smart Swim Goggles</a>, released in 2019, allow you to view your splits and elapsed time while you power through your workout, eliminating the need to stop and check a watch or a clock.</p><p>Because you don't have to wear another device, say, on your wrist, you don't sacrifice hydrodynamics. The device includes physical buttons on one side that allow you to scroll through metrics and menus without taking your goggles off.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are other smart swim goggles on the market, such as the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FINIS Smart Goggles</a>, which offer many of the same features. Both brands will run you about $200.</p><h2 id=garmin-swim-2-waterproof-smartwatch>3. Garmin Swim 2 Waterproof Smartwatch</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-19-at-3-45-07-pm.jpg><p>Several companies, including Apple, Samsung, and Fitbit, offer smartwatches and fitness trackers that swimmers can use. These devices provide many of the same features as smart goggles but, as you can imagine, also do much more.</p><p>For instance, smartwatches can track your resting heart rate, stress levels, and sleep, as well as receive notifications for texts, alerts, and emails in or out of the pool.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the best smartwatches designed specifically for swimmers is the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Garmin Swim 2</a>. It lets you track pool and open water workouts and includes a built-in wrist-based heart rate monitor that works underwater, making it easy to keep track of your effort during swim sessions. Additional exercise features include rest timers and drill log functions to help take your swimming game further.</p><p>The Garmin Swim 2 also automatically tracks, measures, and analyzes distance, pace, and stroke count. By counting these metrics, the device pumps out what it calls a swolf score, a number obtained by adding together the number of strokes you took in a pool length and the time it took to swim that length. For instance, If you took 10 strokes to swim the length of a pool in 30 seconds, you'll get a swolf score of 40.</p><h2 id=waterproof-mp3-players>4. Waterproof MP3 Players</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-28-at-10-45-30-pm.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Music can have a profound impact on the mind and body, and listening to high-tempo music during a workout can distract you, making your activities seem less challenging. Music can also increase your heart rate, resulting in a supercharged workout session. So, we think waterproof MP3 players would be a welcome addition to your swimming routine.</p><p>FINIS, the company that makes all kinds of gadgets for swimmers, from training fins to smart goggles, makes waterproof MP3 players too. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Finis Duo</a> is an underwater bone-conduction MP3 player with 4GB of flash memory and a rechargeable battery that lasts up to 7 hours.</p><p>Another good example would be the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">H2O Audio Sonar</a> bone conduction headphones, featuring a built-in MP3 player, thanks to the 8GB internal storage. These headphones are also IPX8 waterproof and function by transmitting sound waves through an open-air, bone-conduction design and are not inserted into your ears.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=waterproof-headphones>5. Waterproof Headphones</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-19-at-3-41-01-pm.jpg><p>Prefer listening to music on Spotify while swimming rather than loading MP3 onto a dedicated player? Well, <a href=#>swimming headphones and earbuds</a> make that possible. They can stream your favorite songs or podcasts wirelessly using your water-resistant smartwatch or smartphone.</p><p>There are various kinds of waterproof headphones, from simple earbuds to those that attach to your goggles. For example, the JBL Reflect Aero headphones connect to a smart device via Bluetooth, are <a href=#>IP68 dust and water-resistant</a>, and can function in depths of up to 1.5 meters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=underwater-metronome>6. Underwater Metronome</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/swimmer-wearing-a-finis-tempo-trainer-pro.jpg><p>Underwater metronomes are small, waterproof devices that you can use as a swimmer to identify and maintain an ideal pace while in the pool. These devices fit beneath your swim cap or goggles and help you keep pace by transmitting an audible tempo beep.</p><p>Devices such as the FINIS <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tempo Trainer Pro</a> allow you to adjust the tempo speed by 1/100 of a second and can be used out of the water, meaning you can use it for cross-training on a bike or while running.</p><h2 id=the-best-swimming-gadgets-you-should-try>The Best Swimming Gadgets You Should Try</h2><p>If you want to make the most of your swimming sessions, these are some of the best gadgets you can invest in. However, understand what you need to do to get better at swimming, and buy the one that suits your needs instead of wasting your money.</p><p>That said, if you don't have the money to spend on swimming accessories, you can also use mobile apps to enhance your overall experience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiempyXmsG0edOoZKKloKe8t7GMrK6ipZ2eu6h51qippKelqcBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
