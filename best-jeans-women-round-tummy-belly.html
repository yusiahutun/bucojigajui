For our petite friends, keep in mind that it only comes in a 32-inch inseam, but we think this gorgeous fit is worth a trip to the tailor.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Inseam:</strong> 32" | <strong>Size:</strong> 00–32 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 3 | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, polyester, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-old-navy-extra-high-waisted-wide-leg-jeans-for-women></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Old Navy Extra High-Waisted Wide-Leg Jeans for Women</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Old Navy Extra High-Waisted Wide-Leg Jeans for Women" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/kNJtdi702aPcewb3N0sEgE7M3H8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/old-navy-extra-high-waisted-wide-leg-jeans-for-women-fe29f160094b49d8980f720a99988d50.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Old Navy&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The ultra-wide leg balances curvy silhouettes.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>You could feel overwhelmed by the fabric if you’re accustomed to a more tailored fit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As evidenced by our favorite <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>blazers</a> and celeb style (notably, this <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Dua Lipa trench coat look</a>), the ’90s will never reclaim its oversized silhouette. We’re convinced these Old Navy Wide-Leg Jeans have just the right amount of <strong>relaxed, slightly baggy </strong>appeal without looking too sloppy or decade-defying — particularly since the <strong>medium wash </strong>adds a more contemporary touch. Beyond that, the jeans feature a<strong> roomier fit in the hip area</strong> and they reach 1 inch higher than your traditional high-rise jeans so that we feel extra tucked in and ready to wear our teeniest crop tops with confidence. We also appreciate the upper-thigh placement of the holes that won’t stretch into a crater-sized circumference when we bend our knees.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Inseam:</strong> 31” (Standard); 29” (Petite); and 35” (Tall) | <strong>Size: </strong>00–30 | <strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-straight-pistola-charlie-high-rise-classic-straight-ankle></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Straight</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Pistola Charlie High Rise Classic Straight Ankle</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Pistola Charlie High Rise Classic Straight Ankle" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/_7sXl_2FZE_Cc-NRJ6zXej1Lgoc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/pistola-charlie-high-rise-classic-straight-ankle-1c53fc1750104643905c011e563ede1f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Pistola&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>A slightly faded wash and distressed hem make the jeans look vintage, but they wear brand new.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The inseam may be too short for taller frames.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’re sold on the lived-in look of these light-wash denim beauties. Their <strong>high rise</strong> and <strong>straight-leg silhouette</strong> stretch figures. Who could say no to looking long and leggy? And, you can often find us capitalizing on the <strong>slightly tapered leg</strong> by adding heft from our favorite heeled boots. Don’t worry, the mostly<strong> cotton construction </strong>allows for plenty of mobility in the waist and hip area so you won’t relegate to standing jeans only. However, the 27-inch inseam may lend it a too-cropped fit for taller folks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Inseam: </strong>27" | <strong>Size: </strong>24–33 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 |<strong> Material: </strong>Cotton, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-flare-madewell-kick-out-crop-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Flare</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Madewell Kick Out Crop Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Madewell Kick Out Crop Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/tSgRbsAvhFD_uW2gm0seGlqg5gE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Madewell-Kick-Out-Crop-Jeans-da22e03b06f4419abb06d03759fd405a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Madewell</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The cotton fabric has stretch but retains its structure so you’re not swimming in baggy fabric after one wear.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The cropped length limits your shoe options.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s a good reason why tapered pants are a holdover style staple from the ‘70s: The style hugs midsections snugly and flares at the bottom, allowing the silhouette to balance curvy figures for a super flattering fit. “With these Madewell jeans, it’s as if the brand whispered a secret acknowledgment to those yearning for a <strong>longer rise</strong>, <strong>roomier hips</strong>, <strong>and thighs</strong>, confirming that style need not be compromised for fit,” says Leitz. Since a <strong>flare cut </strong>can be tricky (the style tends to look awkward with certain shoes, like ankle-height booties), we appreciate its <strong>versatile design details </strong>like the <strong>mid-rise fit </strong>that pairs well with any type of top and<strong> sophisticated dark wash</strong> colorway that elevates the entire look and matches anything you pull from your closet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Inseam: </strong>27.5” (Standard); 30.5” (Tall); 25.5” (Petite); and 27.5” (Plus) | <strong>Size:</strong> 23–33 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, Lycra</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-mid-rise-reformation-val-belted-mid-rise-straight-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Mid-Rise</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Reformation Val Belted Mid-Rise Straight Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Reformation Val Belted Mid Rise Straight Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/FvwcKkXXit15NC1rPYUGesGIUbg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Reformation-Val-Belted-Mid-Rise-Straight-Jeans-a50d28e9b02e42989a941ef314e410a9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Reformation</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The striking red hue and belted design kick boring denim to the curb.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The inseam is pretty long, but Reformation does offer free alterations.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These party pants serve intense “I’m with the band” energy — suddenly we have the urge to pull on our cropped Bowie T-shirt and slide into our biggest steel-toed stompers. “Adding a splash of color to the denim world, the red jeans by Reformation are a revelation,” says Leitz. The <strong>100 percent soft, stretchy cotton</strong> construction ensures that the <strong>mid-rise fit </strong>won’t uncomfortably dig into your skin and cut waists for an unflattering fit. Instead, it falls right below the belly button, providing coverage and breathing room. Also worth mentioning, the <strong>skinny belt addition </strong>is a nice distraction from waistlines and you can cinch it if you want a more snatched look. “The fitted waist flowing into a relaxed leg offers a silhouette that’s both comfortable and on-trend, proving eco-conscious fashion can be stunning and bold,” Leitz adds. Pro-tip: Pair these with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>kitten heel</a> or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>platform boot </a>to amplify the outfit, and prevent the fabric from dragging on the ground.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Inseam:</strong> 32” | <strong>Size:</strong> 23–34 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 2 | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-high-rise-lane-bryant-tighter-tummy-fit-high-rise-straight-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best High Rise</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lane Bryant Tighter Tummy Fit High Rise Straight Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lane Bryant Tighter Tummy Fit High Rise Straight Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/E6hhQoza2DezHyKCjSBLm6pLmmM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Lane-Bryant-Tighter-Tummy-Fit-High-Rise-Straight-Jean-751f9aa6c21140adb5ae198c3b96a480.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Lane Bryant</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The brand offers the jeans in four different inseams and a very inclusive size range.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>We wish this pair was available in a lighter wash, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Nowadays, size inclusivity is at the forefront of the fashion conversation, but Lane Bryant has been prioritizing curvy women since its inception in 1904. Its T3 Jeans, which feature Tighter Tummy Technology are made with <strong>reinforced high-rise panels</strong> and a Flex Magic waistband. These jeans are meant to eliminate the look of any pouch without digging into the skin. “My preference is the tighter tummy high rise in the dark hue,” says New York City-based celebrity stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Susan Moses</a>, “They’re <strong>comfortable</strong>, <strong>figure flattering</strong>, and <strong>timeless</strong>.” Plus, each pair is made from 10 recycled plastic bottles, so you can feel a little better about your purchase.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Inseam: </strong>31” (Regular); 28” (Petite); 29” (Short); 34” (Long); and 36” (Extra Long) | <strong>Size:</strong> 12–40 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, polyester, rayon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-petites-abercrombie-curve-love-high-rise-mom-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Petites</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Abercrombie High Rise Mom Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Abercrombie Curve Love High Rise Mom Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/wP7DcsQAMaw9o57tXTu0ahuzAgg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Abercrombie-Curve-Love-High-Rise-Mom-Jean-c626fd8747a74543819bb228dcc3ef24.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Abercrombie</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> Along with extended sizing, the brand also offers jeans in short and extra short inseams.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Popular styles sell out quickly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’d bet the ranch you can find a couture-like fit in The Curve Love collection from Abercrombie. It exploded on social media when buyers truly felt like they could get everything on their denim wish list from one place. The retailer offers a diverse<strong> size range </strong>with sizes from 23 to 37, <strong>trendy styles</strong>, and<strong> five different lengths</strong> that cater to every frame, especially petites. In particular, we love these high-rise mom jeans, which hold tummies in with the right amount of suction. You’ll have some extra wiggle room thanks to an additional 2-inch in the waist (a boon for those with wider hips!). Truthfully, we’re surprised to see most of the styles and washes still in stock since the collection is trendy, so act fast.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Inseam: </strong>23.5” (Extra Short); 25.5” (Short); 27.25” (Regular); 29.5” (Long); and over 30” (Extra Long) | <strong>Size: </strong>23–37 | <strong>Colors: </strong>7 | <strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-stretch-spanx-flare-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Stretch</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Spanx Flare Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Spanx Flare Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/yonLDyov68gvc7FmaflSFfFPDfI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/spanx-flare-jeans-3711ff3e37c2474db5043e569662b2fe.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Spanx</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>No zipper or button means you can slip these on in a pinch.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s only available in black.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Universally flattering, everyone from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>our moms</a> to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>our editors</a> wears Spanx jeans. With all the benefits of shapewear and the look of denim, Spanx <strong>stretch denim </strong>delivers a <strong>body-hugging fit </strong>without sacrificing comfort. “The evolution of Spanx from shapewear to sportswear has been amazing,” says Moses. Hidden<strong> smoothing technology flattens</strong> tummies without constricting them. You won’t find any buttons or zippers on these pants, either. Instead, the stretch design allows you to shimmy them on, making them feel like your favorite pair of leggings, rather than jeans. “Spanx has never disappointed regarding support and shaping, but now they can add style to that list,” adds Moses.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Inseam: </strong>34” (Regular); 32” (Petite); and 37” (Tall) | <strong>Size:</strong> XS–XXXL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 4 | <strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, polyester, Lycra</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-light-wash-big-bud-press-light-wash-carpenter-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Light Wash</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Big Bud Press Light Wash Carpenter Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Big Bud Press Light Wash Carpenter Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/faMspsiuqLDYSjkNp8Yw4_ThA8o=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/big-bud-press--light-wash-carpenter-jeans-300e716d6c2c4bffa5171b6fd38d6c44.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Big Bud Press&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>There’s elastic in the back waist for extra breathing room.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It takes time to break in the non-stretch denim.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We don’t plan on doing any heavy lifting in these carpenter pants. (Though the <strong>durable denim construction </strong>would certainly allow us to.) Instead, you can find us capitalizing on the <strong>red stitching</strong> and <strong>eye-catching large pockets</strong> to zhuzh our more basic wardrobe staples. Although rigid denim may seem intimidating if you’re accustomed to stretchier fabrics, plus-size influencer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Jamie Hamilton</a> says, “I prefer a low stretch in denim — ideally, a two percent stretch or less, because denim looks and feels better when it doesn’t stretch out.” She adds that heavier denim generally appears higher-end regardless of price point. Plus, the <strong>elastic waist in the back</strong> allows it to stretch and recover to provide extra space where you might most need it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Between the <strong>ultra high-rise</strong> and a framing-favor <strong>straight-leg silhouette</strong>, we are convinced everyone needs a pair. “I’m not kidding when I say these pants are magic — my mom, aunt, and I, all with vastly different body types, own the exact same Big Bud Press jeans and they’re easily the most flattering pair of pants all of us own,” says InStyle commerce writer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Irene Richardson</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Inseam:</strong> 29” (Standard); 25” (Petite) |<strong> Size:</strong> XXS–XL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Material: </strong>Cotton</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-mom-jeans-everlane-the-curvy-way-high-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Mom Jeans</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Everlane The Curvy Way High Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Everlane The Curvy Way High Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/h2DJaO9NbSOSRCqtWtZ504dv2Dw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/everlane-the-curvy-way-high-jean-0a06696bba984d5ebfc5571dbfb9b57a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Everlane</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This design incorporates everything we love about the 90’s style with smart contemporary touches.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> You have to break in the fabric.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Mom jeans have never fully fallen out of favor, even given the sway that low-rise high-hugger waistlines have on today’s trends. Why? Because no one can deny the ample favors the <strong>vintage silhouette</strong> does for all figures. The Everlane Way-High Jeans complement curves with a two-piece contour waistband that follows hip lines and nips at the waist. Additionally, it's a super <strong>booty-flattering</strong> pair that isn’t overzealous in its wedgie fit. They’re not so trendy that say, you couldn’t wear the dark Indigo or black wash to work with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>blazer</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>comfy heels</a>, and the overall vibe is effortlessly chic.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Inseam:</strong> 27.5” | <strong>Size:</strong> 23–35 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 5 | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-skinny-universal-standard-joni-high-rise-curve-slim-leg></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Skinny</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Universal Standard Joni High Rise Curve Slim Leg</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Universal Standard Joni High Rise Curve Slim Leg" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/bA_uRO2pioqVodUmWOfEzG-qwhY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/universal-standard--joni-high-rise-curve-slim-leg-eaffec8432514aabab25d53a5f1d8f57.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Universal Standard</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Sneaky design details like surprisingly deep pockets and hidden stretch fabric make these the most practical pair, yet still fashionable, of denim you’ll own.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Sizing runs small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Despite what our past, ill-advised purchases might suggest, skinny jeans don’t have to mean skin tight. Universal Standard factors all our favorite aspects of this silhouette hugging style, such as a <strong>snug, slimming fit</strong>, but relies on forgiving materials, like cotton and elastane, to prevent the pants from feeling like a wetsuit. In fact, this signature comfy technology is why the brand is our go-to for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>work pants</a> and other <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>non-denim styles</a> that make us look put together when we’d rather be wearing pajamas. It’s also offered in <strong>four washes</strong>, though the black colorway is particularly versatile and sleek and its tighter fit gives it the illusion of a high-end trouser.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Inseam:</strong> Not listed | <strong>Size:</strong> 00–40 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 4 | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, polyester, rayon, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Silhouette: </strong>Of course, Every body type can rock any jean style. Traditionally, however, high- or mid-rise jeans offer round bellies a more comfortable fit. Additionally, jeans with ankle-length hemlines may help to elongate your form and can de-emphasize wider areas. “Opting for straight-leg or boot-cut jeans can also add an element of balance to the overall look, elongating the legs in a subtle, understated way,” Leitz says.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Stretch:</strong> While it’s nice if your denim has a little give, typically quality denim isn’t stretchy. “If I can stretch it in my hands and the denim changes appearance (looks whiter) — it’s a hard pass,” says Hamilton. But that doesn’t mean it should feel restrictive. She recommends squatting and sitting in denim to ensure it is non-restricting on the thighs, hips, and belly. If you prefer fabric with more give, though, Leitz suggests looking for a blend of cotton and elastane. “It’s a magical mix that offers the best of both worlds — the softness and breathability of cotton, combined with the slight stretch of elastane for an unparalleled ease of movement.”</li><li><strong>Wash: </strong>Don’t shy away from experimenting with how different washes can enhance your natural shape. For instance, “Darker washes tend to offer a sleek, streamlined appearance, which can be extremely flattering,” says Leitz. “However, lighter washes have their own charm, especially when styled creatively with contrasting tops or footwear to draw the eye vertically, enhancing the illusion of height and creating a harmonious blend of comfort and style.”<br></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions Answered&nbsp;</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What kind of jeans are good for a round stomach?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Before picking out your jeans, make a mental checklist in your head. “The most important details to look for in jeans if you have a round tummy is the zipper length and the structure of the denim fabric,” advises Georgia-based stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>McKenzie Crouch</a>. “Zipper length plays a big role in how your jeans fit and look."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For the best fit, your zipper should cover about three-quarters of the front of your jeans. “Shorter zippers can create bunching in the crotch area and give the appearance of camel toe,” explains Crouch. As for structure, try to look for fabrics that don’t contain a lot of stretch otherwise, it will draw attention to your tummy area.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, Leitz says “High-waisted pieces are the unsung heroes here, cinching at the smallest part of your waist and crafting an elongated silhouette.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What are the best jeans for my body type?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Honestly, it all comes down to trial and error and your style goals. “If it’s physical comfort — I encourage folks to try on different rises and levels of stretch,” says Hamilton.
