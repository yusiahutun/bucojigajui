Aside from his career success, Frank Sinatra was known for hosting wild parties at his Farralone mansion, where he lived for 10 years. Now, we can look inside the stunning property and imagine what the Golden Age of Hollywood was really like.</strong></p><p>The <a href=#>music</a> star rented out the property during the 1950s, with Frank Sinatra and his Rat Pack pals spending a lot of time in the Farralone mansion. The New Jersey native would invite the most popular <a href=#>celebrity</a> guests – including Marilyn Monroe – to his parties to unwind. The star, who has been regarded as living during the Golden Age of Hollywood, also broke into cinema himself throughout his career. Sinatra, nicknamed ‘Chairman of the Board’, sidestepped into the <a href=#>movie</a> business at the height of his career, from the late 1940s and predominantly the following decade. But how and where did he spend his downtime? Let’s find out.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-socialite-heir-to-huge-fortune-built-the-mansion>Socialite heir to huge fortune built the mansion</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/image_h_10-1024x682.jpg><p>Before ol’ Frank Sinatra called Farralone his home for ten years, it had another star owner.</p><p>The <a href=#>real estate</a> dream was first designed and built in 1949 by socialite Dora Hutchinson. Hutchinson, heir to the Chase Manhattan Bank fortune, asked architect William Pereira to design her something new.</p><p>Known for his futuristic style, he got to work on the design. He was one of the most famous individuals in his field at the time and managed to capture modern design and blend it with <a href=#>Hollywood</a> glamour. Not only that, but he knew his way around showbiz too. Pereira was also a director, film set designer and producer for several films in the 1940s. He even won an Oscar for his special effects photography work on Reap the Wild Wind in 1942.</p><p>The architect worked on more than 400 projects throughout his career, including Washington DC’s Kennedy Center, LA County Museum of Art and the 1933 Chicago World’s Fair. But, his most famous piece is known as the Transamerica Pyramid, based in sunny San Francisco. In 1963, Time Magazine featured him on the cover for his city mast plan involving Irvine, California.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-everyone-who-was-anyone-was-invited>Everyone who was anyone was invited</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/image_h_27-1024x682.jpg><p>Back to Hutchinson, she wanted a modern build to entertain her celebrity friends – it was Hollywood, of course. As soon as she moved in, she called up her pals for her famous parties and would often put on firework displays to start her famous cocktail hour.</p><p>She was definitely the talk of Tinsel Town, hosting the wedding of Judy Garland and inviting <a href=#>TV</a> icon Lucille Ball and Ava Gardner amid her long list of party guests. But others who appeared in her Farralone mansion included none other than Frank Sinatra himself and the Rat Pack.</p><p>It was when she decided to venture back east to New York City when she rented the property to singer Frank. He then called it home for 10 years.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-frank-sinatra-s-farralone-mansion-was-a-celebrity-hotspot>Frank Sinatra’s Farralone mansion was a celebrity hotspot</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/image_h_06-1024x682.jpg><p>It’s safe to say Frank Sinatra had 10 interesting years at Farralone, similarly to the mansion’s socialite owner.</p><p>He brought in a new era of entertaining for Hollywood, including his political pals and Rat Pack buds.</p><p>Everyone who was anyone was invited, and it’s said Marilyn Monroe was a regular attendee. Hollywood whispers she spent time with John F Kennedy in the guest house – but that could just be legend.</p><p>Aside from private matters, it’s also been used in more than 500 films and music videos, you’ve probably seen it without realizing. The house was used in <a href=#>Beyoncé</a>‘s film Dreamgirls, Transformers and Nicole Kidman’s Bewitched. <a href=#>Hugh Jackman</a>‘s flick with Halle Berry also features the property.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/image_h_15-1024x681.jpg><p>In terms of the small screen, you may recognize it from Mad Men and Californication, but when it comes to music video stardom, you can count on Mariah Carey, <a href=#>Rihanna</a> and Usher calling upon it for the perfect backdrop.</p><p>Built on a mountaintop overlooking the San Fernando Valley, it also became the place to be to rub shoulders with our stars. <a href=#>Paul McCartney</a> would serenade guests at the piano, and celebrity poker games would be the home to place a bet.</p><p>Standing at 6,661-square-feet, it took two years to build, with it being completed in 1951.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-inside-farralone>Inside Farralone</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/image_h_19-1024x682.jpg><p>Named after the street name, the moniker is said to also represent ‘far’ and ‘alone’. Sitting on the top with gorgeous views, it’s easy to see why. Leave behind the bustling life of LA and get away from the crazy life of Tinsel Town with this property.</p><p>Sadly, it sits behind gates, a mile-long driveway and is surrounded by four acres of land. You won’t be able to get a glimpse driving past, but thanks to <a href=# rel=nofollow>TopTenRealEstateDeals.com</a> we now can see inside.</p><p>It’s been completely restored and 60% of the walls are made from 5-meter tall panes of glass, offering natural light across the entire abode.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/image_h_12-1024x682.jpg><p>It also means the views are unmatched. The home overlooks the 536-hectare Chatsworth Nature Preserve and mountain range. If the city is more your thing, it also has 360-degree views over Los Angeles in the distance, with more than 3,000 acres of nature preserve at your fingertips.</p><p>The guest house has its own pool and garden, so it’s a great stop for friends and family – or even call up AirBnB for some dollar on the side?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-surprisingly-small-number-of-bedrooms>Surprisingly small number of bedrooms</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/image_h_25-1024x682.jpg><p>Despite its huge size and remarkable views, Farralone, also known as Byrdview, has just four bedrooms and six full bathrooms. That’s more toilets than beds.</p><p>But the rest make up for it. It features multiple large parlors – for entertaining, of course. One even has an original zebra cork flooring in the home.</p><p>There’s a formal dining room and several fireplaces to keep you cozy during winter nights.</p><p>The large primary suite helps sell the property, as well as the eat-in chef’s kitchen if you want to eat like a Hollywood icon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/image_h_22-1024x682.jpg><p>The bar, formal dining area and large kitchen features an island. If you also agree breakfast is the most important meal of the day, then the breakfast nook will be your new favorite place to savor pancakes.</p><p>The 50-meter swimming pool is the perfect place to get in your laps or morning workout. The 186-square-metre pergola lounge area is great for outdoor dining. If vino is to your taste, the vineyard is ideal for boosting your own collection.</p><p>And if you’re in a tight spot and don’t fancy the commute, the helipad will surely come in handy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/image_h_13-1024x682.jpg><p>We can’t forget the recording studio, gym and massage room – catering to all your hobbies and well-being needs.</p><p>Previously, the estate was on the market for more than $21 million, but has now been slashed to almost a third of the price. What a steal? Now, prospective buyers can nab it for just $8.99 million via Frontgate Real Estate.</p><p>Maybe move the strange sculptors by the front door if you’re not a fan, though.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2Z%2FcLXNrKCdnV2bv6K6ymaqoqaRqb%2Biv4yfpqullad6rq3NrKCopl2ptaLAjKGYrGWnmrazsIysmq6koKnCs7HSZpmyZaSdsm6y0ailrWWUpLyzew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
