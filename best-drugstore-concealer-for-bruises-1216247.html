To get the most out of your concealer you need to make an informed choice and we hope the tips we give you will help you in this.</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Choose Best Drugstore Concealers for Bruises</h2></p><p>The most important thing you need to remember while concealing the unwelcome additions on your skin is to ensure it fits your needs. Here’s a list of things that can help you check if the concealer fits the bill.</p><h3><strong>Shade</strong></h3><p>If you are trying to camouflage a red bruise, acne, sunburn, rosacea, pimples or redness of your skin, you should go for a green concealer. A purple shade is good for yellow bruises on your face while a yellow concealer is what you need to cover up spider veins, dark circles and bluish bruises. A peach or pink shade does wonders in brightening your skin tone.&nbsp;</p><p>Your skin tone also plays a huge role in choosing the shade of your concealer to get the best concealer for bruises. For light to medium skin tones, peach toned concealers are a good match while for deeper skin tones, oranges or reds are a better match.</p><h3><strong>Type of Concealer</strong></h3><p>Concealers are broadly available in 3 forms — powder, liquid and pencil which differ in viscosity. Powder concealers are the lightest but are not very long-lasting. Liquid concealers have a creamy texture and are a dream to blend. Pencil concealers are very good for spot coverage and don’t create a mess but are not very blendable/</p><h3><strong>Type of Skin Problem</strong></h3><p>Different problem areas of your skin require different concealers. If you are looking specifically for a concealer to cover bruised skin or other skin discoloration for an even tone to your skin, a creamy formula is what you need. For acne, age spots and blemishes, a powder concealer or a lightweight formula work best. Tattoos require a much thicker concealer, while covering redness requires a lighter concealer.</p><h3><strong>Type of Coverage</strong></h3><p>There is a whole range of concealers available that offer full coverage with a buildable base. This gives your skin a smooth, natural looking finish while covering bruises, blemishes and redness of the skin. Make sure that your concealer offers an even base so that you can use less makeup. It should offer ample coverage and not settle in the creases and fine lines of your face.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Long-lasting Effects</strong></p><p>Your concealer should hold up for the entire day in camouflaging bruises and discoloration. At the same time, it should also hold up as far as consistency is concerned without drying out or creasing. Look for a product that is resistant to heat, humidity and sweat.</p><p>After going through our pointers on how to choose the best drugstore concealer for bruises, you need to know how to use it effectively so that you draw complete benefit and satisfaction from it. Here are a few things to keep in mind while using your concealer for flawless and perfect skin.</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Use Best Drugstore Concealers for Bruises</h2></p><p>The right shade of concealer is the key to camouflaging bruises and giving a luminous glow to your skin.</p><ul><li>&nbsp;For that, you need to first identify your correct skin tone either with a shade card or with the help of a professional makeup artist.</li><li>Secondly, acquaint yourself with the shade that works for a particular color of bruise. Your concealer should be opposite to the bruise color on the color wheel. So, a green concealer would work best for red bruises, yellow for blue or purple bruises, a blue concealer for orange bruises and white for brown bruises. Also for dark bruises a thick concealer is a better option while light scars are covered effectively with a lightweight concealer.</li><li>The last thing to do is gently apply and blend the concealer to the bruise. Apply foundation over the concealer and finish with a translucent powder.</li></ul><p>Now that you’ve been familiarised with the 12 best drugstore concealers for bruises, we can rest assured that you’ll make an informed choice.

We hope our take on the 12 best drugstore concealers for bruises will help you get the flawless skin of your dreams.</p><h2 class=title>FAQ's</h2><p>What do I need to know before buying a concealer?</p><p>As most of us have a tinge of yellow tone in our skin, it’s best to choose a concealer with a yellowish tone rather than a pink tone. Also selecting the right shade is a must. Always go for a concealer that is a shade or two lighter than your foundation. Your concealer should have the right texture which means it should be creamy and not dry or greasy.</p><p>How do you cover up a bruise under your eye?</p><p>First, allow the swelling under your eyes to subside.Then, draw a V under your eyes with a concealer brush. Gently blend the concealer inside the V. Reapply if the bruise still shows. Finish off with setting powder.</p><p>What color concealer covers dark bruises?</p><p>A red or purple bruise is best concealed with a combination of green and yellow concealers. As the bruise starts turning yellow, use a green concealer. For a brownish colored bruise, a lavender concealer works well.</p><p>How do you cover a bruise with color correcting concealer?</p><p>Any bruise can be effectively covered with a neutralizing concealer. They refer to those colors which are opposite each other on the color wheel like green is neutralized by red and blue is neutralized by orange. So basically, a green concealer would cover up a red bruise, but for best results you would need to follow up by applying some foundation over the concealer.</p><h2 class=title>Why Trust Pinkvilla</h2><p>While minor acne and skin inflammations don’t do much to spoil your makeup look, discolorations caused by bruises are indeed quite visible.
