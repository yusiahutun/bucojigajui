During an appearance on the &#34;Lunch with Bruce&#34; podcast on Monday October 11, Daniel Craig revealed that he prefers to frequent gay bars over their straight counterparts to avoid getting roughed up.

And I did," he stated. "That would happen quite a lot. And it would just be a good place to go."</p><p>However, personal safety wasn't the only added benefit to being a heterosexual man in a gay bar -- as the 53-year-old told podcast listeners that he sometimes had an "ulterior motive."</p><p>"Everybody was chill, everybody. You didn't really have to sort of state your sexuality. It was okay. And it was a very safe place to be," he explained. "And I could meet girls there, cause there are a lot of girls there for exactly the same reason I was there. It was kind of an ulterior motive."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a92186b6-cbd1-4afd-a685-d415279a82e6 data-container-ref=toofab:article:bbd99d8b-4360-49a9-8bbf-b1a520a7167d data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f3/5by4/2021/09/21/f3d123f3bc324a418fb203527d3ad142_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Everett Collection</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Search For Next James Bond Will Start In 2022, Daniel Craig Promises It Won't Be This Actor</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Craig also recalled an incident with friend and podcast host <a href=#>Bruce Bozzi</a> where they were "caught" during a night out at a gay bar in Venice, California.</p><p>"For me, it was one of those situations and the irony is, you know, we kind of got 'caught', I suppose, which was kind of weird [be]cause we were doing nothing f---ing wrong," Craig laughed.</p><p>"What happened is we were having a nice night and I kind of was talking to you about my life when my life was changing and we got drunk and I was like, 'Oh, let's just go to a bar, come on, let's f--king go out,'" said Craig.</p><p>"And I just was like, 'I know I don't give a fuck,' and we're in Venice," he recalled.
